#!/bin/bash
# rite workflow - Wiki Ingest Commit (shell-only raw source commit path)
#
# Responsibility: commit all pending raw source files under .rite/wiki/raw/
# to the configured wiki branch in a SINGLE shell process, without any
# dependency on Claude orchestrator multi-step execution.
#
# Pair script: `../wiki-ingest-trigger.sh` (in plugins/rite/hooks/, not in
# hooks/scripts/). The trigger is a pure file writer that stages raw
# sources under `.rite/wiki/raw/{type}/`; this script is the shell
# committer that moves those files onto the wiki branch. Grep for
# `wiki-ingest-trigger.sh` when auditing the wiki capture / commit path.
# The two scripts form a tightly-coupled pair despite living in different
# directories. The placement asymmetry is transitional — both should
# eventually live in hooks/scripts/. No dedicated tracking Issue exists
# yet for the consolidation; grep this file for "placement asymmetry"
# when the cleanup Issue is filed so the matching comment in
# wiki-ingest-trigger.sh (if any) can be updated together.
#
# This script is the shell-only counterpart of commands/wiki/ingest.md
# ステップ 5.1 Block A + Block B. It exists because the markdown-based ステップ
# 5.1 requires Claude to chain three Bash tool invocations across an LLM
# Write/Edit phase, which is structurally fragile under E2E output
# minimization and sub-skill auto-continuation failures, where repeated
# silent-skip defence layers proved ineffective. By moving the git
# stash/checkout/commit/push sequence into a
# single shell script, the raw source always lands on the wiki branch as
# long as this script is invoked even once — regardless of whether Claude
# correctly continues its prose contract afterwards.
#
# Scope boundary: this script commits raw sources only. It does NOT run
# the LLM-driven page integration — that is owned by the /rite:wiki:ingest
# Skill and can be executed later, manually or automatically. The split
# enforces a clean separation:
#
# (1) raw source capture — wiki-ingest-trigger.sh (file writer)
# (2) raw source commit path — THIS script (shell, deterministic)
# (3) wiki page integration — /rite:wiki:ingest (LLM)
#
# Steps (1) and (2) together guarantee that the wiki branch grows for
# every review/fix/close cycle, even if step (3) is deferred.
#
# Usage:
# bash wiki-ingest-commit.sh [--dry-run]
#
# Options:
# --dry-run Report the pending raw sources and the target wiki branch
# but perform no git operations. Returns exit 0 even when
# pending sources exist (unlike the normal path).
#
# Exit codes:
# 0 success (pending raw sources were committed, OR there were none)
# 1 argument / environment error (not a git repo, detached HEAD, etc.)
# 2 wiki feature disabled or wiki branch missing (treated as skip)
# 3 git operation failure (stash / checkout / commit — push NOT included)
# 4 push failed after successful local commit (commit landed locally,
# but origin push failed — a distinct code so the caller surfaces a plain
# WARNING instead of folding the push failure into a success report).
#
# Notes:
# - Designed to be idempotent: when called with no pending raw sources,
# it exits 0 without touching git state.
# - Preserves any unrelated uncommitted work in the current branch via
# full `git stash push -u`, and pops the stash afterwards.
# - The current branch is restored before exit on the happy path. On
# cleanup failure (checkout-back failing or stash pop failing), a
# manual-recovery hint is printed to stderr and the staging directory
# is preserved so the user can recover by hand. This is best-effort,
# not absolute — see the cleanup_body function for the exact semantics.
# - Emits a structured status line to stdout on success so the caller
# (review.md / fix.md / close.md Phase X.X.W) can observe the result:
# [wiki-ingest-commit] committed=<N>; branch=<wiki>; head=<sha>
# or when there is nothing to do:
# [wiki-ingest-commit] committed=0; branch=<wiki>; reason=no-pending
# --- END HEADER ---

# HIGH #1 / HIGH #2 — rollback-safety rewrite.
#
# This rollback-safety design guards two latent failure modes that surface only
# on error / signal paths (the happy path is unaffected, so empirical AC-1/2/3
# dogfooding does not catch them):
#
# (a) Attempting stash pop unconditionally even after checkout-back to
# $current_branch fails would apply a dev-branch stash while the HEAD is
# still on the wiki branch — corrupting the wiki branch working tree with
# unrelated dev-branch changes.
#
# (b) Capturing `local rc=$?` on cleanup entry is unsafe when cleanup is
# reached via a signal trap (INT/TERM/HUP): bash's `$?` at that point
# reflects the last completed command (usually 0 on the happy path — e.g.
# after `echo "[wiki-ingest-commit] ..."`), not the signal. cleanup would
# then see rc=0, skip the staging-dir restore block, and exit 0, so a SIGINT
# mid-run would silently drop the raw sources on the floor.
#
# Fix:
# - cleanup_body takes an explicit rc parameter (`$1`) instead of
# reading `$?`, so signal handlers can pass the POSIX-conventional
# exit codes (130 = SIGINT, 143 = SIGTERM, 129 = SIGHUP).
# - stash pop is gated on a successful checkout-back. If we fail to
# return to $current_branch, the stash is deliberately left intact
# and a manual-recovery hint is printed so the user can resolve the
# state by hand. No silent cross-branch pop.
# - The staging-dir restore now fires on any non-zero rc, including
# signal-forced exits, so SIGINT mid-copy does not lose raw sources.

# verified-review cycle 5 CRITICAL (F-01): この初期化ブロックと関数定義は以前
# **Step 3 冒頭 (stash push の直前)** に配置されており (before commit 5212573)、
# Step 3 以降でのみ必要と想定されていた。しかし Step 2 の
# `rm -f "$f" 2>"${git_err:-/dev/null}"` と直後の `dump_git_err "rm -f $f"`
# 呼び出しが前方参照していた。rm 失敗時に (1) stderr が常に /dev/null に routing
# され rm の OS エラーが失われ、(2) `dump_git_err` は `command not found` で set -e
# 配下で rc=127 abort し `exit 3` に到達しない — cycle 4 で cherry-pick した「rm
# stderr を propagate する」修正が構造的に無効化されていた。Step 1 は git_err を
# 参照しないため Step 1/Step 2 の境界に helper block を配置することで、Step 2 の
# rm 失敗経路が正しく診断情報を出せるようにし、cycle 4 の error-handling contract
# を再び有効にする。
#
# Cycle 2 MEDIUM (noise reduction): only dump stderr on failure paths.
# Calling `dump_git_err` after **every** git command, including successful ones,
# surfaces git informational messages like `Switched to branch 'wiki'` on stderr —
# noise that drowns out real error signals. So the helper is failure-only; success
# paths call `surface_git_warnings` which only prints lines matching
# `^(warning|hint|error):`.
#
# git_err cleanup is delegated to `cleanup_body` (see the EXIT/INT/TERM/HUP
# traps below). A separate trap would overwrite cleanup_body's and break the
# HIGH #1/#2 rollback-safety rewrites from cycle 1.
#
# verified-review cycle 4 HIGH #4: mktemp failure must NOT silently swallow
# all git stderr. The previous `|| echo ""` fallback made dump_git_err and
# surface_git_warnings no-op (guarded on `[[ -n "$git_err" ]]`) while the
# stderr redirect `2>"${git_err:-/dev/null}"` kept routing git errors to
# /dev/null. Net effect: every real git failure on a /tmp-broken host was
# diagnosable only by re-running the script without this wrapper. Emit an
# explicit WARNING so the operator understands why git stderr disappears,
# and set git_err="" so the no-op path is obvious from the warning trail.
