#
# Tests for caller HTML inline literal symmetry across the
# create-interview.md example output blocks.
#
# Issue #832 — split out from the 4-site-symmetry concern as a
# dedicated lint script (option B in the Issue's three-way decision).
# Background: PR #830 removed the prose that documented this 2-site
# symmetry; this test restores machine-verifiable drift detection.
#
# Purpose:
#   The /rite:issue:create-interview sub-skill emits a return block
#   ending in one of two HTML-commented sentinels:
#     <!-- [interview:skipped] -->   (XS / Bug Fix / Chore preset)
#     <!-- [interview:completed] --> (S / M / L / XL after deep-dive)
#
#   Both example blocks (Output format example sections in
#   create-interview.md) must contain an *identical*
#   `<!-- caller: ... -->` line that instructs the orchestrator to
#   run a Step 0 Immediate Bash Action. The bash literal embedded in
#   that comment must match across both examples so that an LLM
#   reading either example sees the same contract.
#
#   This test verifies:
#     1. There are exactly 2 occurrences of `<!-- caller:` in
#        create-interview.md (one per example block).
#     2. The 2 occurrences are byte-equal (full-line equality).
#     3. The literal contains all 6 required elements:
#          bash plugins/rite/hooks/flow-state-update.sh patch
#          --phase create_post_interview
#          --active true
#          --next 'Step 0 Immediate Bash Action fired ...'
#          --if-exists
#          --preserve-error-count
#
# When this test fails:
#   The 2 example blocks have drifted, typically because someone
#   updated one block but missed the symmetric update in the other.
#   Restore symmetry by replicating the change across both blocks.
#   Do NOT relax this test — symmetry restoration is the correct fix.
#
# Relationship with `4-site-symmetry.test.sh`:
#   That test guards CLI-arg PRESENCE (--phase / --active / --next /
#   --preserve-error-count) at file-level grep granularity for the 2
#   files commands/issue/create.md and commands/issue/create-interview.md.
#   This test is narrower and stricter: full-line byte equality of the
#   2 caller HTML inline literals within create-interview.md alone.
#   The two are complementary; neither subsumes the other.
