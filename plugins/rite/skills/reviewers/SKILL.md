# Reviewer Skills - Main Coordinator

**File naming convention**: `SKILL.md` is the coordinator file for the skill group. Each expert skill is named in `{type}.md` format (e.g., `security.md`, `api.md`).

## Overview

This skill coordinates the multi-reviewer PR review process using specialized expert agents.

## Auto-Activation

This skill is activated during `/rite:pr:review` command execution.

## Available Reviewers

The table below shows primary file patterns. Each skill file's Activation section defines additional detailed patterns.

| Reviewer | Skill File | File Patterns (Primary) |
|----------|------------|-------------------------|
| Security Expert | `security.md` | `**/security/**`, `**/auth/**`, `auth*`, `crypto*`, `**/middleware/auth*` |
| Performance Expert | `performance.md` | `**/*.sh`, `**/hooks/**`, `**/api/**`, `**/services/**` |
| DevOps Expert | `devops.md` | `.github/**`, `Dockerfile*`, `docker-compose*`, `*.yml` (CI), `Makefile` |
| Test Expert | `test.md` | `**/*.test.*`, `**/*.spec.*`, `**/test/**`, `**/__tests__/**`, `jest.config.*`, `vitest.config.*`, `cypress/**`, `playwright/**` |
| API Design Expert | `api.md` | `**/api/**`, `**/routes/**`, `**/handlers/**`, `**/controllers/**`, `openapi.*`, `swagger.*` |
| Frontend Expert | `frontend.md` | `**/*.css`, `**/*.scss`, `**/styles/**`, `**/components/**`, `*.jsx`, `*.tsx`, `*.vue` |
| Database Expert | `database.md` | `**/db/**`, `**/models/**`, `**/migrations/**`, `**/*.sql`, `prisma/**`, `drizzle/**` |
| Dependencies Expert | `dependencies.md` | `package.json`, `*lock*`, `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml` |
| Prompt Engineer | `prompt-engineer.md` | `commands/**/*.md`, `skills/**/*.md`, `agents/**/*.md`, and corresponding `.mdx` (`commands/**/*.mdx`, `skills/**/*.mdx`, `agents/**/*.mdx`) |
| Technical Writer | `tech-writer.md` | `**/*.md` (excluding `commands/**/*.md`, `skills/**/*.md`, `agents/**/*.md`), `**/*.mdx` (excluding `commands/**/*.mdx`, `skills/**/*.mdx`, `agents/**/*.mdx`), `docs/**`, `documentation/**`, `**/README*`, `CHANGELOG*`, `CONTRIBUTING*`, `*.rst`, `*.adoc`, `i18n/**/*.md`, `i18n/**/*.mdx` (excluding `plugins/rite/i18n/**` — rite plugin's own translations are dogfooding artifacts) |
| Error Handling Expert | `error-handling.md` | Files containing `try`, `catch`, `throw`, `Error`, `reject`, `fallback` keywords (JS/TS); `set -e`, `pipefail`, `trap`, `|| true`, `|| :`, `2>/dev/null` keywords (Bash); `**/*.sh` |
| Type Design Expert | `type-design.md` | `**/*.ts`, `**/*.tsx`, `**/*.rs`, `**/*.go` with `interface`, `type`, `enum`, `class`, `struct` |

**Note**: The table above shows representative patterns only. Each skill file's Activation section is the source of truth. The tech-writer row is kept in sync with `plugins/rite/commands/pr/review.md` ステップ 1.2.7 `doc_file_patterns` and `plugins/rite/skills/reviewers/tech-writer.md` Activation section; see [`plugins/rite/commands/pr/references/internal-consistency.md`](../../commands/pr/references/internal-consistency.md#cross-reference) Cross-Reference section for the drift-prevention invariant. Automated drift detection is implemented by `plugins/rite/hooks/scripts/doc-heavy-patterns-drift-check.sh` (Issue #353 系統 1; invoked from `/rite:lint` ステップ 3.7 as a warning/non-blocking check). The tech-writer row uses **set semantics** (file matching equivalence), not pattern syntax equality — the order of patterns and exact glob syntax may differ across the 3 files (this file, `tech-writer.md`, `review.md`) as long as the matched file set is identical. See `tech-writer.md` Activation section's note for the canonical equivalence statement.

**Code Quality co-reviewer rule**: Code Quality reviewer is additionally selected as a co-reviewer in the following cases:

1. **Code block co-reviewer**: When `.md` files matching Prompt Engineer patterns contain fenced code blocks (` ```bash `, ` ```sh `, ` ```yaml `, etc.) in the diff, Code Quality is added alongside Prompt Engineer. This ensures embedded code snippets receive code quality review.
2. **Sole reviewer guard**: When exactly 1 reviewer has been selected after all Phase 2.3 detection rules, Code Quality is automatically added as a co-reviewer. This prevents single-reviewer blind spots (cross-file inconsistency, missing updates). Does not activate when 2+ reviewers are already selected, or when Code Quality is already the sole reviewer (fallback).

**Emoji usage policy**: Emojis are used only for the following visibility purposes. Individual skill file Findings output must not use emojis:
- Unified report header (`📜 rite レビュー結果`)
- Work memory identifier (`📜 rite 作業メモリ`)
- Important warning display (`⚠️ 矛盾する指摘を検出`)

**Language policy**: Section headings use English; descriptions and notes use Japanese. Pattern descriptions in tables may use Japanese for brevity.

## Finding Quality Policy

All reviewers must follow these quality standards when reporting findings. These are detailed in each skill file's "Finding Quality Guidelines" section.

> **Reference**: See [Finding Examples](./references/finding-examples.md) for concrete Few-shot examples of good findings, findings that should NOT be reported, and borderline judgment cases.

### Observed Likelihood Gate + Fail-Fast First (全 reviewer 共通)

> **Reference**: [`agents/_reviewer-base.md`](../../agents/_reviewer-base.md) の "Observed Likelihood Gate" / "Fail-Fast First" 節と [`references/severity-levels.md`](../../references/severity-levels.md#impact--observed-likelihood-matrix) の Impact × Likelihood Matrix を必ず参照すること。

**Observed Likelihood Gate**:

- 指摘事項化の必要条件は (1) Confidence ≥ 80 + (2) Likelihood ≥ Demonstrable + (3) revert test pass の **3 ゲート同時充足**
- Demonstrable の立証範囲は **diff 適用後のコードベース全体**（既存 + 本 PR 追加）
- 立証手段は 4 種 (`existing_call_site` / `new_call_site` / `entrypoint_connection` / `runtime_observation`) のいずれか。`内容` 列に `Likelihood-Evidence: <label> <location>` の literal prefix を必ず記載（詳細は `agents/_reviewer-base.md` の "Demonstrable: proof of burden" 節）。**例外**: Hypothetical Exception Category reviewer (security / database (migration) / devops (infra) / dependencies) が Hypothetical finding を retain する場合は `Likelihood-Evidence:` を省略し、代わりに `Likelihood: Hypothetical (例外カテゴリ: <name>)` を `内容` 列に記載する (canonical 定義は `_reviewer-base.md` の "Hypothetical Exception Category interaction" 節)
- Hypothetical は降格（**例外カテゴリ**: security / database (migration) / devops (infra) / dependencies の 4 reviewer のみ Hypothetical でも severity 維持可能）
- Grep 失敗だけで Hypothetical 扱いにしない。dynamic dispatch / hook / framework convention / 設定駆動ルーティングはエントリポイント接続で Demonstrable 立証可

**Fail-Fast First**:

- fallback (null 返却 / default 値 / catch swallow / retry-and-give-up) を推奨する **前に** `throw` / `raise` / 再 throw を必ず検討
- 既存の error boundary に到達できる経路があれば throw を選ぶ
- skill 側 (各 reviewer の `.md`) に「fallback 許容条件」が明示されている場合のみ fallback 推奨可
- project convention と衝突する可能性がある場合は `/rite:wiki:query <keyword>` で Wiki を必須参照し、Wiki に許容パターンが記録されていればそれを尊重
- reviewer 自身が fallback 追加を推奨することは silent failure の **共犯行為** とみなされる

### Skeptical Tone Calibration

Before starting your review, adopt the following investigative mindset:

**You are investigating this code under the assumption that it contains problems.** Your job is not to confirm the code works — it is to find where it breaks, where it misleads, or where it silently degrades. Approach every function, every boundary, every implicit assumption as a potential failure point.

However, skepticism is not the same as hostility:
- **Investigate thoroughly** before concluding something is a problem
- **Drop the suspicion** when investigation reveals the code is correct — do NOT manufacture findings to justify your initial assumption
- **Calibrate severity honestly** — a real LOW is better than an inflated MEDIUM

The goal is not to maximize the number of findings. The goal is to ensure that **real problems are never missed because you assumed the code was fine**.

### All Findings Are Mandatory Fixes

**Every finding reported will be treated as a mandatory fix** — there is no auto-defer or gradual relaxation mechanism. The review-fix loop continues until all findings are resolved (0 findings remaining).

This means reviewers must exercise careful judgment about what to report:

| Guideline | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Report Only Substantive Issues** | Only report findings that genuinely improve code quality, correctness, or maintainability |
| **No Nitpicking** | Avoid trivial style preferences, pedantic naming suggestions, or cosmetic issues that do not affect functionality or readability |
| **No Hypothetical Concerns** | Do not report speculative issues ("this might cause problems in the future") without concrete evidence |
| **Consider Fix Cost vs Value** | If the effort to fix exceeds the value gained, do not report it as a finding |

### Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **No Vague Findings** | Vague findings like "needs confirmation" or "may be an issue" are prohibited |
| **Investigate First** | Investigate before reporting (use Read, Grep, WebSearch, etc.) |
| **Concrete Evidence Only** | Only report findings with concrete facts and evidence |
| **No Finding If Unconfirmed** | Do not report findings that could not be confirmed after investigation |

### Investigation Tools

Reviewers should investigate using these tools before reporting:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Read** | Check contents of related files/documents |
| **Grep** | Search patterns within the codebase |
| **Glob** | Explore related files |
| **WebSearch** | Gather information via search queries (CVEs, best practices, multi-source comparison) |
| **WebFetch** | Fetch details from specific URLs (official docs, known references) |

### Examples

**Prohibited (vague):** "May need verification", "Possible security risk", "Might affect performance"

**Required (concrete):** Cite specific evidence from investigation (Grep results, file locations, OWASP references, performance metrics)

### External Claim Awareness

When citing external specifications (library behavior, tool configuration, version compatibility, API behavior, CVE/vulnerability information) in findings, reviewers should follow these guidelines:

| Guideline | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Cite specific versions** | Include the version number when claiming version-specific behavior (e.g., "npm v11.10.0 introduced..." instead of "npm supports...") |
| **Prefer observable facts** | Reference behavior observable in the codebase (package.json versions, config files) rather than general claims about external tools |
| **Flag uncertainty** | If unsure about external behavior, note "要検証" in the recommendation column to signal that fact-checking should prioritize this claim |
| **Avoid speculation** | Do not claim specific library/tool behavior without concrete evidence from investigation or documentation |

**Note**: External specification claims in findings are verified by the Fact-Checking Phase (`review.md` ステップ 5 Critic Phase) using WebSearch/WebFetch against official documentation. Claims found to contradict official documentation are removed from the review report and recorded in a dedicated section. Reviewers benefit from accuracy here because contradicted findings are flagged as errors, reducing overall review quality.

## Reviewer Type Identifiers

Mapping of reviewer identifiers (`reviewer_type`) to display names. Update this table when adding new reviewers.

| reviewer_type | 日本語表示名 | Skill File |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| security | セキュリティ専門家 | `security.md` |
| performance | パフォーマンス専門家 | `performance.md` |
| devops | DevOps 専門家 | `devops.md` |
| test | テスト専門家 | `test.md` |
| api | API 設計専門家 | `api.md` |
| frontend | フロントエンド専門家 | `frontend.md` |
| database | データベース専門家 | `database.md` |
| dependencies | 依存関係専門家 | `dependencies.md` |
| prompt-engineer | プロンプトエンジニア | `prompt-engineer.md` |
| tech-writer | テクニカルライター | `tech-writer.md` |
| code-quality | コード品質専門家 | `code-quality.md` |
| error-handling | エラーハンドリング専門家 | `error-handling.md` |
| type-design | 型設計専門家 | `type-design.md` |

**Note**: This table is the source of truth. `commands/pr/review.md` also references this table. The `code-quality` reviewer is used as a fallback when no other reviewers match (see "No Reviewers Match" section below and `review.md` ステップ 3.2), as a co-reviewer for Prompt Engineer files containing fenced code blocks, and as a sole reviewer guard co-reviewer (see "Code Quality co-reviewer rule" above).

## Reviewer Selection Algorithm

### Phase 1: File Pattern Matching

```text
For each changed file:
  1. Match against all reviewer patterns
  2. Collect matching reviewers
  3. Track file count per reviewer
```

### Phase 2: Content Analysis (Optional)

```text
Analyze diff content for:
  - Security keywords (representative): password, token, secret, auth, crypto, hash, encrypt, decrypt, credential, api_key, private_key, cert
  - Performance keywords (representative): cache, async, await, promise, worker
  - Data keywords (representative): query, migration, schema, index, transaction
  - Error handling keywords (representative): try, catch, throw, Error, reject, fallback, finally (JS/TS); set -e, pipefail, trap, || true, || :, 2>/dev/null (Bash)
  - Type design keywords (representative): interface, type, enum, class, struct, readonly, generic
```

**Note**: The above are representative keyword examples. The authoritative keyword list is defined in `commands/pr/review.md` ステップ 2.3 ("Security keyword detection" section). Detailed activation patterns are defined in each reviewer skill file (`security.md`, `database.md`, etc.) under the Activation section.

### Phase 3: Select All Matching Reviewers

```text
Select all reviewers that:
  1. Match file patterns from Phase 1
  2. Match content keywords from Phase 2 (if enabled)

No prioritization by file count.
All matching reviewers are selected.
```

### Phase 4: Apply Minimum Limit

```text
Apply constraints from rite-config.yml:
  - min_reviewers: Minimum reviewers to select

Special rules:
  - Security reviewer inclusion depends on rite-config.yml security_reviewer settings (see review.md ステップ 3.2)
  - If no reviewers match, use code-quality reviewer as fallback (min_reviewers)
```

**Note**: For detailed mandatory selection conditions for Security Expert, see [`commands/pr/review.md` ステップ 3.2 (Reviewer Selection)](../../commands/pr/review.md#32-reviewer-selection).

## Skill Loading Strategy (Progressive Disclosure)

### Metadata Only (Initial)

Return only reviewer list and file counts.

**Data retention approach:**

Claude retains selection results internally for use in subsequent phases. Specifically:

1. **At Phase 2 completion**: Remember the following information
   - List of selected reviewers (reviewer_type)
   - Files assigned to each reviewer
   - Selection rationale
   - Selection type for Security Expert (mandatory / recommended / detected), if selected

2. **Usage in Phase 4**: Embed remembered information into each Task tool's `prompt` parameter

**Note**: No explicit output as JSON or data structures. Information is retained within Claude's conversation context and referenced in the necessary phases.

**Context management strategy:**

For context management during large PR reviews, see [references/context-management.md](./references/context-management.md). Refer to that file as the source of truth for detailed thresholds and guidelines.

### Full Skill Load (On Demand)

Load complete skill file only when reviewer is activated:

```text
Read skill file: {plugin_root}/skills/reviewers/{type}.md
Extract:
  - Review checklist
  - Severity definitions
  - Output format
```

**Example behavior:**

If PR changed files are `src/api/users.ts` and `src/auth/login.ts`:

1. **Phase 1**: Pattern matching identifies API Expert and Security Expert as candidates
2. **Phase 2**: Content analysis detects `auth`, `token` keywords, boosting Security Expert priority
3. **Phase 3**: Select Security Expert and API Expert (2 reviewers)
4. **Phase 4**:
   - Read `skills/reviewers/security.md` via Read tool, embed in Task tool prompt
   - Read `skills/reviewers/api.md` via Read tool, embed in another Task tool prompt
   - Execute both Tasks in parallel

## Generator-Critic Pattern Integration

This skill implements the Generator-Critic pattern for enhanced review quality.

**Phase mapping:**
- **Generator Phase** = `commands/pr/review.md` **ステップ 4** (Parallel review execution)
- **Critic Phase** = `commands/pr/review.md` **ステップ 5** (Result validation & integration)

### Generator Phase

Each selected reviewer acts as a **Generator**:
1. Receives PR diff and context
2. Applies specialized checklist
3. Produces findings in structured format

### Critic Phase

After all generators complete, a **Critic** phase validates:
1. Cross-check findings across reviewers
2. Identify contradictions
3. Validate severity assessments
4. Produce unified report

### Feedback Loop

If Critic identifies issues:
1. Flag contradicting findings
2. Request clarification from specific generators
3. Produce final reconciled report

## Cross-Validation Logic

Logic to validate and integrate results from multiple reviewers.

See [references/cross-validation.md](./references/cross-validation.md) for details.

### Quick Reference

- Multiple reviewers flag same file/line → severity +1
- Contradiction between reviewers → request user judgment
- All reviewers pass → high-confidence approval

## Output Aggregation

For review result output format, see [references/output-format.md](./references/output-format.md).

### Quick Reference

**Individual Reports:** Each reviewer generates Domain-Specific Analysis + Findings table + Summary

**Unified Report:** Coordinator integrates Overall Assessment + Reviewer Consensus + Cross-Validated Findings

**Findings table format (common):**

| Severity | Scope | File:Line | Issue | Recommendation |
|----------|-------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| {level}  | {scope} | {location}| {WHAT + WHY} | {FIX + EXAMPLE} |

The `Scope` column accepts `current-pr` / `follow-up` / `nit-noted` (schema 1.1.0+, Issue #1016). See [_reviewer-base.md Scope Assignment Flowchart](../../agents/_reviewer-base.md#scope-assignment-flowchart) for assignment rules and the [Severity × Scope Matrix](../../references/severity-levels.md#severity--scope-matrix) for forbidden combinations.

## Error Handling

### Skill File Not Found

```
If skill file missing:
  1. Log warning
  2. Use fallback inline profile
  3. Continue with remaining reviewers
```

### Reviewer Timeout

**Note**: Task tool timeout is managed internally by Claude Code. Users cannot directly specify a `timeout` parameter.

```
If reviewer task exceeds internal timeout:
  1. Task tool returns an error
  2. Mark the reviewer as "incomplete"
  3. Continue with other reviewers' results
  4. Note "{reviewer_type}: タイムアウト" in unified report
```

### No Reviewers Match

When no file patterns match, use code-quality reviewer as fallback. Security Expert inclusion follows `rite-config.yml` settings (see `review.md` ステップ 3.2).

```text
If no file patterns match:
  1. Use code-quality reviewer as fallback (min_reviewers)
  2. Apply Security Expert selection rules from rite-config.yml (see review.md ステップ 3.2)
  3. Warn user about limited review scope
  4. Suggest manual reviewer selection if needed
```
