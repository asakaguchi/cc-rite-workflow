# rite workflow - Worktree-scoped git add/commit/push helper
#
# Responsibility: provide the canonical `git -C <worktree> add / commit /
# push` flow with stderr tempfile capture, head -n 10 extraction, and
# exit-code semantics shared by:
# - wiki-worktree-commit.sh (pages/index/log commits on wiki branch)
# - wiki-ingest-commit.sh (worktree fast path for raw-source ingest)
#
# Design rationale (Issue #549): PR #548 cycle 4 F-06 identified that the
# add/commit/push block + error handling (stderr tempfile -> head -n 10
# -> sed prefix) was structurally identical across the two scripts. A
# shared helper removes that drift vector. PR #550 review further
# tightened the contract so the lib does not silently toggle caller
# shell options or clobber caller traps.
#
# Usage:
# source "$_SCRIPT_DIR/lib/worktree-git.sh"
# worktree_commit_push "$worktree_path" "$wiki_branch" "$commit_msg" "$wiki_rel"
# rc=$?
# case "$rc" in
# 0) ;; # committed and pushed
# 3) exit 3 ;; # add/commit failed — error already surfaced to stderr
# 4) push_failed=true ;; # commit landed, push failed
# 5) ;; # no staged diff — caller decides policy (stdout is silent)
# esac
#
# Arguments:
# WORKTREE path to the worktree (caller must have validated it)
# BRANCH expected branch name for the push (caller-validated;
# lib does NOT re-derive via `rev-parse --abbrev-ref`
# because a detached HEAD would silently fall back to
# the literal "HEAD" and misclassify push failures).
# COMMIT_MSG commit message (must not contain newline / CR — callers
# that read from user input should validate first)
# PATH1... pathspecs to `git add --`. At least one is required.
#
# Exit codes:
# 0 success — committed and pushed
# 2 argument error (missing worktree / branch / commit message / pathspec)
# 3 git add or commit failed (error details already on stderr)
# 4 commit OK, push failed (caller should emit wiki_ingest_push_failed
# sentinel and decide whether to exit 4 or continue)
# 5 no staged diff after add (no-op, caller decides skip/success)
#
# stdout:
# On exit 0 or 4: "head=<sha>; push=<ok|failed>"
# On exit 5: (empty — caller emits its own reason=no-staged-diff)
# Otherwise: empty (errors are on stderr)
#
# Contract:
# - Does NOT toggle `set -e` / `set -u` / `set -o pipefail`. The
# function saves the caller's `errexit` state before any `set +e`
# probe and restores it before return, so the caller's shell-option
# environment is preserved in every exit path.
# - Does NOT install EXIT / INT / TERM / HUP traps that persist past
# return. Any trap installed for internal tempfile cleanup is
# restored to the caller's previous trap via `trap -p` / `eval`
# before every return path, so the caller may install its own
# outer trap without surprise clobbering.
# - Signal-handling limitation: while this helper is executing, its
# internal trap OVERRIDES the caller's signal traps for EXIT / INT
# / TERM / HUP. Signals delivered during the helper body (e.g.
# user Ctrl-C while `git push` is in flight) clean up the helper's
# internal tempfiles only — the caller's signal-driven cleanup
# (e.g. stash pop on SIGINT) is NOT invoked until after the helper
# returns and the caller's trap is restored. Callers that need
# signal-safe rollback during helper execution must either wrap
# the helper in their own subshell or accept best-effort cleanup.
# - Nested function `_wtgp_restore_caller_state` leaks into the
# caller's global scope (bash dynamic scoping). The underscore
# prefix marks it as a private helper: callers MUST NOT invoke it
# directly from outside `worktree_commit_push`, and MUST NOT
# redefine a function with the same name.
# - Caller must have ALREADY verified:
# * worktree exists at WORKTREE path
# * worktree HEAD is on BRANCH
# * COMMIT_MSG has been checked for newline/CR injection
# * BRANCH matches the expected wiki.branch_name

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# verify_worktree_branch: confirm a worktree's HEAD is on an expected branch.
#
# Responsibility: eliminate the duplicated rev-parse
# --abbrev-ref HEAD verification block that previously lived in both
# wiki-worktree-commit.sh and wiki-ingest-commit.sh. Both callers ran
# essentially the same sequence (mktemp stderr tempfile + scope-limited
# trap + `set +e` / `set -e` fence + rev-parse + ERROR + `head -3` + rm -f
# + branch compare) with only the tempfile prefix differing. This helper
# centralizes that logic so fixes propagate to both callers automatically.
#
# Usage:
# verify_worktree_branch "$worktree_path" "$wiki_branch" "wwc" "$extra_hint"
# # returns 0 if worktree HEAD == expected_branch
# # returns non-zero after emitting ERROR to stderr (caller should exit 1)
#
# Arguments:
# WORKTREE worktree path (caller has already confirmed existence)
# EXPECTED_BRANCH branch name the worktree must be on
# TEMPFILE_TAG short tag (4-8 chars) for the mktemp prefix, so
# concurrent runs from different callers produce
# distinguishable tempfile names. Example: "wwc",
# "wic-wt".
# EXTRA_HINT optional extra stderr line to emit when the branch
# mismatch is detected (used by ingest-commit.sh to
# clarify that silent fall-through would be even more
# confusing). Pass empty string to omit.
#
# Exit codes:
# 0 worktree is on expected branch
# 2 rev-parse failed (worktree corrupt / permission / git binary issue)
# 3 worktree is on a different branch
# shellcheck source=../../control-char-neutralize.sh
