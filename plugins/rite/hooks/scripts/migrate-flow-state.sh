# rite workflow — Legacy `.rite-flow-state` Auto Migration (Issue #672 / #679)
#
# Detects legacy `.rite-flow-state` files (`schema_version` missing or `< 2`)
# and migrates them to the per-session path `.rite/sessions/{session_id}.flow-state`
# (Option A, multi-state design — see docs/designs/multi-session-state.md).
#
# Migration is a 5-step rename strategy:
#   1. Detect legacy file
#   2. Resolve session_id (read from legacy state, or generate fresh UUID)
#   3. Atomic write new format file (mktemp + mv)
#   4. Rename legacy source to `.rite-flow-state.legacy.{timestamp}.{pid}.{random}`
#      (suffix unique-ifies the path so concurrent migrations within the same
#      second don't silently overwrite each other's backup — #747 cycle 4 HIGH)
#   5. Emit explicit migration message on stderr (silent skip is forbidden — AC-8)
#
# Failure handling preserves legacy state untouched:
#   - step 3 failure: no new file left behind, legacy intact
#   - step 4 failure: new file removed, legacy intact
#
# Usage:
#   STATE_ROOT="/path/to/repo" bash migrate-flow-state.sh           # apply
#   STATE_ROOT="/path/to/repo" bash migrate-flow-state.sh --dry-run # detect only
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — migrated, no-op (already v2 or no legacy file), or dry-run completed
#   1 — migration failed (legacy state preserved)
#
# Called from `session-start.sh` at the earliest opportunity so subsequent
# hook reads land on the per-session path.

# migration. This is the documented rollback path (Issue #672 §Rollback).
# Reuses the canonical _resolve-schema-version.sh helper. The helper is
# documented to "always exit 0" (echoes "1" or "2" on stdout), so we call it
# without a defensive `|| fallback` to stay symmetric with state-read.sh and
# flow-state-update.sh's _resolve_schema_version function. If the helper file
# is missing, fall through to the legacy default; the resolution itself never
# fails by contract.
