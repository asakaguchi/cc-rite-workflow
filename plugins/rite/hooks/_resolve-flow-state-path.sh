# rite workflow - Flow-State Path Resolver (private internal helper)
#
# Resolves the active flow-state file path for lifecycle hooks
# (session-start / session-end / pre-compact / post-compact).
#
# Returns one of:
#   - per-session: <state_root>/.rite/sessions/<session_id>.flow-state
#   - legacy:      <state_root>/.rite-flow-state
#
# Resolution rules (mirrors path-selection rules of state-read.sh / flow-state-update.sh;
# cross-session classification is the caller's responsibility via session-ownership.sh):
#   1. schema_version=2 + valid UUID SID + per-session file exists
#      -> per-session path
#   2. schema_version=2 + valid UUID SID + per-session absent + legacy exists
#      -> legacy path (lets the lifecycle hook touch the still-current legacy
#         file before migration completes)
#   3. schema_version=2 + valid UUID SID + neither file exists
#      -> per-session path (for fresh writes; writers create the file)
#   4. schema_version=1 OR missing SID OR invalid UUID
#      -> legacy path
#
# Note: state-read.sh additionally performs cross-session classification
# (same/empty/foreign/corrupt/invalid_uuid 5-way) to reject reads from another
# session's state file. This helper does NOT replicate that — lifecycle hooks
# instead use `check_session_ownership` from session-ownership.sh for the same
# guarantee. See Cross-session ownership note below.
#
# Cross-session ownership checking is the caller's responsibility. This helper
# resolves the path only. Lifecycle hooks already invoke
# `check_session_ownership` (session-ownership.sh) for the "other session"
# branch, so layering another guard here would duplicate that contract.
#
# ⚠️ Caller contract (Issue #749):
#   When this helper returns a per-session path
#   (`<state_root>/.rite/sessions/<sid>.flow-state`), the caller MUST invoke
#   `check_session_ownership` from session-ownership.sh and skip the modify
#   path on the "other" branch. Reading or modifying another session's active
#   per-session state file would clobber its in-flight work memory and trip
#   stop-guard whitelist violations on its next phase transition.
#
#   Failing this contract risks: (1) silent overwrite of another session's
#   .active=false transition, (2) double-emit of cross-session incidents,
#   (3) lifecycle warnings (#475 / #608) firing for the wrong session.
#
#   `_validate-helpers.sh` intentionally does NOT validate
#   `_resolve-cross-session-guard.sh` here because this helper does not call
#   it directly — the caller-side check is sufficient.
#
# Current callers:
#   Lifecycle 4 hooks (with Issue #749 stderr pass-through pattern, contract critical):
#     - plugins/rite/hooks/session-start.sh   (defensive reset on startup/clear)
#     - plugins/rite/hooks/session-end.sh     (deactivation on session end)
#     - plugins/rite/hooks/pre-compact.sh     (timestamp update before compact)
#     - plugins/rite/hooks/post-compact.sh    (recovering→normal transition)
#
#   Other hooks (no stderr pass-through, RITE_DEBUG-gated diagnostic only — Issue #681):
#     - plugins/rite/hooks/post-tool-wm-sync.sh   (writer; check_session_ownership 呼出済)
#     - plugins/rite/hooks/pre-tool-bash-guard.sh (read-only; ownership check 不要)
#
#   Command-level callers (silent fall-through to empty state_file via `|| state_file=""`):
#     - plugins/rite/commands/issue/create.md
#     - plugins/rite/commands/pr/cleanup.md
#   (PR #1079 で create-interview.md は create.md に統合済)
#
#   New callers MUST follow the caller contract above. When adding a new
#   caller, append it under the appropriate category here AND update the
#   keyword loop in tests/_resolve-flow-state-path.test.sh
#   (TC-749-CALLER-CONTRACT) so the static grep test enforces enumeration
#   completeness.
#
# Why this exists (Issue #680):
#   The lifecycle 4 hooks each used the same hardcoded `<state_root>/.rite-flow-state`
#   path, which forces a global single-file lock and breaks the O(1)-per-session
#   guarantee that schema_version=2 promised. Centralising the resolution here
#   keeps the four hooks consistent (Wiki #586 — state machine 2-place drift)
#   while leaving state-read.sh / flow-state-update.sh untouched (Issue #4/#5
#   handle them).
#
# Usage:
#   STATE_FILE=$(bash plugins/rite/hooks/_resolve-flow-state-path.sh "$STATE_ROOT")
#
# Arguments:
#   $1 state_root  Repository root (typically resolved via state-path-resolve.sh)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — success (path printed to stdout)
#   1 — argument error / helper deploy regression
