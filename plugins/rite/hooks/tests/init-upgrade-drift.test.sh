# Static / offline drift + consistency tests for the `/rite:init --upgrade` config
# follow-through (Issue #1446).
#
# Sources the shared `_test-helpers.sh` (Issue #1450) for pass / fail /
# assert_grep / assert_not_grep / _helpers_resolve_repo_root / print_summary,
# so the pass/fail stream, glyphs (✅/❌) and summary block follow the same
# convention as the other source-based tests in this directory.
#
# Verifies:
#   T-10 (AC-10): every active top-level key in the template above the
#        `# --- Advanced (below this line) ---` marker is enumerated in init.md's
#        "Active top-level sections covered on --upgrade" drift anchor. A new
#        template section that is not listed in init.md fails this test, forcing
#        init.md to be updated so `--upgrade` does not silently miss it.
#   T-11 (AC-11): the template and init.md agree that `multi_session:` is
#        back-added on --upgrade (with `enabled: true`), and no stale "do NOT
#        back-add" / "NOT back-added" / "left absent" wording survives in either
#        file.
#   T-12 (Issue #1448): every DIRECT sub-key of each active top-level section
#        (above the `# --- Advanced ---` marker) is enumerated in init.md's
#        "Active sub-keys covered on --upgrade" drift anchor, under its section's
#        row. This extends T-10's protection one level down: a new sub-key added
#        to an existing template section that init.md fails to list fails this
#        test, forcing init.md to be updated so `--upgrade` does not silently
#        miss it (mirrors the sub-key merge rule, init.md Step 6 item 4).
#   T-13 (Issue #1459): the `--upgrade` `current >= latest` short-circuit path is
#        routed through Step 4 Identify -> Step 6 Apply (drift back-add) instead of
#        skipping Step 4-6, and the Wiki-only Step 3.5 block is folded into Step 6
#        item 7. Static guards on init.md's branching table + Step 6 wording; the
#        back-add behavior itself runs in the LLM procedure (init.md), not a fixture,
#        so these assert the corrected routing cannot silently regress.
