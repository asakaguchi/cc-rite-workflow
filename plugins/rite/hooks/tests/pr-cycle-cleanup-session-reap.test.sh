# Tests for pr-cycle-cleanup.sh Step 5 — session worktree lazy reap
# (S4, multi-session design §8).
#
#   AC-1: a worktree whose claim is LIVE is NOT reaped.
#   AC-2: a worktree whose claim is STALE and clean IS reaped, claim file deleted.
#   AC-3: a DIRTY worktree is NOT reaped (claim stale) — WARNING + manual hint.
#   AC-4: after reap a MERGED branch is recovered (TC-4); an UNMERGED, non-manifest-recorded branch is preserved (B-01) — #1670 refined "preserve the branch" to "recover merge-confirmed branches only, never destroy unmerged work".
#   AC-5: `.rite/wiki-worktree` and non-issue dirs are NOT matched (regression).
#
# Gate 0 — self-exclusion guard. A long-lived session must never
# reap the worktree it is itself running in (the real incident: review Step 1.0.0
# deleted the in-flight worktree under a stale/free claim). TC-7..TC-11 invoke
# cleanup FROM INSIDE the candidate worktree (or via RITE_WORKTREE) and assert it
# survives even when gates 1-3 alone would reap it:
#   TC-7  → AC-1: cwd == self worktree → NOT reaped (would-be-reaped: stale+clean)
#   TC-8  → AC-2: the self-exclusion skip is logged to stderr (not silent)
#   TC-9  → AC-3: a coexisting OTHER stale orphan is still reaped (surgical)
#   TC-10 → AC-4: a dirty self worktree is also never reaped (TC-3 covers
#                       the dirty + non-self half — Gate 3 unchanged)
#   TC-11 → AC-1: RITE_WORKTREE env resolves self even when cwd is elsewhere

# Issue #1945 — corpse age-guard manifest bypass, keyed on PATH not branch. A
# corpse cannot resolve its checked-out branch (git no longer recognizes the
# tree), so the #1966 branch-keyed bypass above structurally never matches
# one — every corpse would wait the full 24h even when cleanup.md Step 4-W
# already recorded the failed removal. cleanup.md now records the worktree's
# own PATH into the manifest (under the distinct `session_worktree` type —
# NOT the ephemeral-artifact `worktree` type Step 4.5 reaps ungated) when
# removal fails/is skipped for a busy/sandbox-mask reason (only when the PR
# was merged — AC-4 parity with the branch bypass). Step 5's corpse age
# guard checks for that PATH entry before falling back to the 24h wait.
