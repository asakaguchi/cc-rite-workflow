# Migration Guide: Named Subagent Switch for `/rite:pr:review`

**Target version**: rite workflow plugin ≥ 0.x.y (Phase B merge)
**Affected command**: `/rite:pr:review`
**Change classification**: **Breaking Change** (user-facing behavior, reviewer invocation mechanism)
**Issue**: [#358](https://github.com/B16B1RD/cc-rite-workflow/issues/358) (parent: [#355](https://github.com/B16B1RD/cc-rite-workflow/issues/355))

## 1. What changed

Prior to this change, `/rite:pr:review` invoked all reviewer agents via `subagent_type: general-purpose`. The reviewer identity (agent body from `plugins/rite/agents/*-reviewer.md`) was extracted and injected into the **user prompt** as a placeholder (`{agent_identity}`). Since `general-purpose` ignores the target agent file's YAML frontmatter (`model`, `tools`), the reviewer identity had no enforcement at the runtime level — it was just text the LLM might or might not follow.

After this change, reviewers are invoked via the scoped named form:

```
subagent_type: "rite:{reviewer_type}-reviewer"
```

Examples:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `subagent_type: general-purpose` (identity via `{agent_identity}` in user prompt) | `subagent_type: rite:security-reviewer` |
| `subagent_type: general-purpose` | `subagent_type: rite:code-quality-reviewer` |
| `subagent_type: general-purpose` | `subagent_type: rite:tech-writer-reviewer` |

Under named subagent invocation, the **agent file body** (`plugins/rite/agents/{reviewer_type}-reviewer.md`) becomes the sub-agent's **system prompt** automatically. The YAML frontmatter (`model`, `tools`) is honored by the runtime. Reviewer discipline now has the same enforcement level as any other named sub-agent in Claude Code.

### Hybrid approach for shared principles

`plugins/rite/agents/_reviewer-base.md` contains **shared reviewer principles** (Reviewer Mindset, Cross-File Impact Check, Confidence Scoring) that apply to every reviewer. These are **not** automatically injected into named subagents, because `_reviewer-base.md` is a reference file — not a named sub-agent.

To preserve the Cross-File Impact Check (added as a Phase A bug fix — tracked as [Issue #357](https://github.com/B16B1RD/cc-rite-workflow/issues/357) and merged via [PR #363](https://github.com/B16B1RD/cc-rite-workflow/pull/363)), Phase B adopts a **hybrid approach**:

- Agent-specific identity (Core Principles, Detection Process, Detailed Checklist, Output Format) is delivered via the named subagent's **system prompt**
- Shared principles (from `_reviewer-base.md`) are extracted as `{shared_reviewer_principles}` and injected into the **user prompt** — preserving the Phase A bug fix without duplicating 40 lines of content across 13 agent files

This keeps `_reviewer-base.md` as the single source of truth for shared reviewer discipline.

## 2. Who is affected

- **Users running `/rite:pr:review` on opus**: Reviewer quality should improve due to stronger system-prompt-level identity enforcement. No action required.
- **Users running `/rite:pr:review` on sonnet**: 9 of 13 reviewer agents (`api`, `database`, `dependencies`, `devops`, `frontend`, `prompt-engineer`, `security`, `tech-writer`, `test`) have `model: opus` pinned in their frontmatter. Previously this pin was ignored because `general-purpose` doesn't honor agent frontmatter. After Phase B these reviewers will **force-upgrade to opus**, which may increase cost. See [opus Recommendation](#3-opus-recommendation) for why this is intentional.
- **Users on older Claude Code installations**: See [Claude Code version requirement](#4-claude-code-version-requirement).
- **Plugin consumers (not developing rite)**: This change is applied automatically when the plugin updates. No manual configuration needed.

---

## 3. opus Recommendation

This Phase B improvement is **most effective on opus**. In sonnet environments, the Detection Process and Cross-File Impact Check rigor that named subagent invocation unlocks may not translate to proportional review quality gains, because sonnet's weaker instruction-following dilutes the system prompt's authority.

If you currently run `/rite:pr:review` on sonnet and do not want the cost increase from forced opus upgrade, you can opt out by editing `plugins/rite/agents/*-reviewer.md` and removing the `model: opus` lines in the YAML frontmatter. This reverts each reviewer to session default (typically sonnet). Be aware this partially undermines the Phase B quality gains.

---

## 4. Claude Code version requirement

Named scoped subagent invocation (`rite:xxx-reviewer`) requires a Claude Code version that supports:

- Plugin-scoped sub-agent names with the `{plugin_name}:{agent_name}` format
- Automatic sub-agent body loading as system prompt for Task tool calls with `subagent_type` set to a scoped name

If your Claude Code installation does not support this format, `/rite:pr:review` will fail at the retry classification step with `subagent resolution failure`. See [Rollback Scenario 1](#rollback-scenario-1-all-reviewer-subagent-resolution-fails).

To check your Claude Code version:

```bash
claude --version
```

If the version is too old, upgrade Claude Code first, then re-run `/rite:pr:review`.

## 5. Rollback scenarios

### Rollback Scenario 1: All reviewer subagent resolution fails

**Symptom**: Every `/rite:pr:review` invocation fails with `subagent resolution failure` for every reviewer. Task tool returns `Agent type 'rite:xxx-reviewer' not found. Available agents: ...`.

**Cause**: Plugin not installed correctly, version mismatch, or agent file moved.

**Workaround (manual)**: Revert all Phase B changes on your local branch while keeping the Phase A fixes. The exact commands depend on whether Phase B has already been merged into the base branch.

**Pre-merge rollback** (you still have the Phase B feature branch locally, before it is merged):

Identify all Phase B commits on the feature branch and revert them in reverse chronological order (newest first):

```bash
# List all Phase B commits accumulated on the feature branch
# (includes the base refactor commit, the docs commit, and any subsequent fix commits from review cycles)
git log --oneline refactor/issue-358-named-subagent-switch ^develop

# Example output — the exact SHAs and count depend on how many review-fix cycles ran:
#   69f9080 fix(review): cycle 1 レビュー指摘 3 件対応 (#371 #358)
#   9e93a71 docs(migration): named subagent 切替の Migration Guide + CHANGELOG + README 更新
#   763166a refactor(review): named subagent 切替で reviewer 呼び出しを刷新

# Revert ALL listed commits in reverse chronological order (newest first)
# For the example output above:
git revert 69f9080 9e93a71 763166a

# If your feature branch has more or fewer commits (e.g., additional review-fix cycles),
# adjust the SHA list accordingly — always include every commit listed by `git log`.
```

> **Why all commits matter**: Review-fix cycles can add additional commits (`fix(review): cycle N` etc.) that are semantically part of Phase B. Reverting only a subset leaves `review.md` and related files in an inconsistent state where some lines reference `rite:{reviewer_type}-reviewer` while others still reference `general-purpose`.

**Post-merge rollback** (Phase B has already been merged into `develop`/`main` via a merge commit):

This repository uses merge commits (not squash merges) by default, so the Phase B PR appears as a single merge commit in the target branch. Reverting a merge commit requires the `-m <parent-number>` flag:

```bash
# Find the Phase B merge commit on the target branch.
# Search by the Phase B PR number for the most reliable match —
# searching by #358 (Issue number) can also match unrelated merge commits that reference the Issue in passing.
git log --merges --grep='#371' develop

# Revert the merge commit, specifying parent 1 (the mainline parent):
git revert -m 1 <phase-b-merge-commit-sha>
```

> **Why `-m 1` is required**: Without `-m`, `git revert` fails with `commit is a merge but no -m option was given` because it cannot automatically determine which parent represents the "mainline" to revert back to. `-m 1` tells git to treat the first parent (the target branch before merge) as the mainline and revert the changes introduced by the second parent (the feature branch).

In both cases, the Phase A fixes (Part A bug fix, tools/model frontmatter cleanup) remain intact because they were merged via [PR #363](https://github.com/B16B1RD/cc-rite-workflow/pull/363) (which fixed [Issue #357](https://github.com/B16B1RD/cc-rite-workflow/issues/357)) as a separate PR that is not touched by the Phase B revert. After rollback, `subagent_type: general-purpose` with `{agent_identity}` extraction is restored and reviewers fall back to the pre-Phase-B behavior.

**Long-term fix**: Upgrade Claude Code to the version that supports plugin-scoped subagent names.

### Rollback Scenario 2: tech-writer-reviewer fails due to Bash permission

**Symptom**: `/rite:pr:review` works for most reviewers but `tech-writer-reviewer` fails in Doc-Heavy PR Mode because it cannot execute `gh api` or `Bash` commands.

**Cause**: `plugins/rite/agents/tech-writer-reviewer.md` frontmatter does not inherit `tools` correctly. This should not happen because Phase A removed the `tools:` key from all 13 reviewer frontmatters, making them inherit session defaults.

**Workaround (hotfix)**: Add an explicit `tools:` field to the tech-writer-reviewer frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: tech-writer-reviewer
description: Reviews documentation for clarity, accuracy, and completeness
model: opus
tools: [Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, WebFetch]
---
```

The other 12 reviewers continue using Phase B named subagent invocation unchanged.

### Rollback Scenario 3: Verification mode output format broken

**Symptom**: `/rite:pr:review` in verification mode (re-review after fix) produces unexpected output format. The `### 修正検証結果` table is missing or malformed.

**Cause**: Under Phase B, verification mode uses the same user prompt mechanism as full review (案 C). The Phase 4.5.1 verification template in the user prompt should still drive the verification output format. If the system prompt (agent body) contains a conflicting `## Output Format` section, the reviewer may default to full-review format.

**Workaround**: Force `subagent_type: general-purpose` for verification mode only by adding a conditional branch in `plugins/rite/commands/pr/review.md` Phase 4.3.1:

```
if (review_mode == "verification") {
  subagent_type = "general-purpose"
} else {
  subagent_type = "rite:{reviewer_type}-reviewer"
}
```

This falls back to Phase A behavior for verification while keeping Phase B for full review. Apply as a temporary hotfix until the verification output format issue is investigated.

## 6. How to verify Phase B is active

After updating the plugin, run `/rite:pr:review` on any PR. Check the conversation log for:

1. Task tool invocations use `subagent_type: "rite:xxx-reviewer"` (not `general-purpose`)
2. No error messages like `Agent type 'rite:xxx-reviewer' not found`
3. Review results include per-reviewer sections (`#### Security Reviewer`, `#### Code Quality Reviewer`, etc.) in the PR comment
4. The integrated review comment (`📜 rite レビュー結果`) appears normally

If all four conditions hold, Phase B is active and working.
