# Contributing to Claude Code Rite Workflow

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Claude Code Rite Workflow!

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `jq` (required by hook scripts)
3. The plugin uses Rite Workflow itself for development (self-hosting)
4. Set `rite@rite-marketplace: false` in `~/.claude/settings.json` to avoid plugin dual-load collision when developing locally

## Hook Development Guide

Hooks are shell scripts that respond to Claude Code lifecycle events. They are registered via `plugins/rite/hooks/hooks.json` (native plugin hook management) and executed automatically by Claude Code. For legacy setups without `hooks.json`, `/rite:init` falls back to registering hooks under the `hooks` key in `.claude/settings.local.json` — see the Hook Events and Registration section below.

### Hook Directory Structure

```

> **Note**: Context pressure monitoring hooks (previously `context-pressure.sh`, `post-compact-guard.sh`) were retired in PR #481 / commit 77f0c49. Stop/compact recovery is now handled by `stop-guard.sh` + `pre-compact.sh` + `post-compact.sh` + `session-start.sh` exclusively.

### Hook Events and Registration

Rite Workflow uses native Claude Code plugin hook management via `plugins/rite/hooks/hooks.json`. When the plugin is installed (or developed locally), Claude Code reads this file and registers all hooks automatically — no manual edits to `.claude/settings.local.json` are required.

For legacy setups or environments where `hooks.json` is unavailable, `/rite:init` falls back to registering hooks under the `hooks` key in `.claude/settings.local.json`. The following is a partial example of that fallback format:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash /path/to/hooks/stop-guard.sh" }]
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash /path/to/hooks/pre-tool-bash-guard.sh" }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Available hook events:

| Event | Trigger | Input |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `Stop` | Claude attempts to stop responding | JSON via stdin (`cwd`, etc.) |
| `SessionStart` | Session begins or resumes | JSON via stdin (`cwd`, `source`) |
| `SessionEnd` | Session ends | JSON via stdin |
| `PreCompact` | Before context compaction | JSON via stdin |
| `PostCompact` | After context compaction | JSON via stdin |
| `PreToolUse` | Before a tool is executed | JSON via stdin (tool name via `matcher`) |
| `PostToolUse` | After a tool is executed | JSON via stdin |

### Writing a New Hook

1. Create a new script in `plugins/rite/hooks/`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# rite workflow - Your Hook Name
# Brief description of what it does
set -euo pipefail

INPUT=$(cat)

CWD=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.cwd // empty')
if [ -z "$CWD" ] || [ ! -d "$CWD" ]; then
  exit 0
fi

# Your hook logic here
```

2. Make it executable: `chmod +x plugins/rite/hooks/your-hook.sh`
3. Register it in `plugins/rite/hooks/hooks.json` (native plugin hook registration) and — for legacy fallback — in `init.md` (Phase 4.5.2) so it also lands in `.claude/settings.local.json`
4. Write tests in `plugins/rite/hooks/tests/your-hook.test.sh`

### Hook Conventions

- Always use `set -euo pipefail` at the top
- Read JSON input from stdin using `INPUT=$(cat)` and parse with `jq`
- Use `state-path-resolve.sh` to resolve the state root directory
- For guard hooks (e.g., `stop-guard.sh`, `pre-tool-bash-guard.sh`): exit code `0` means "allow", non-zero means "block"
- For non-guard hooks (e.g., `session-start.sh`, `notification.sh`): exit code `0` indicates successful execution
- Use `mktemp` for temporary files with `trap 'rm -f "$tmpfile"' EXIT` for cleanup
- Keep hooks fast — they run on every matching event

## Shell Script Testing

The project uses a lightweight custom test framework (not bats) located in `plugins/rite/hooks/tests/`.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bash plugins/rite/hooks/tests/run-tests.sh

# Run a single test
bash plugins/rite/hooks/tests/stop-guard.test.sh
```

### Test File Structure

Test files follow the `*.test.sh` naming convention. Each test file has this structure:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Tests for your-hook.sh
# Usage: bash plugins/rite/hooks/tests/your-hook.test.sh
set -euo pipefail

SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)"
HOOK="$SCRIPT_DIR/../your-hook.sh"
TEST_DIR="$(mktemp -d)"
PASS=0
FAIL=0

# Prerequisite check
if ! command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "ERROR: jq is required but not installed" >&2
  exit 1
fi

cleanup() {
  rm -rf "$TEST_DIR"
}
trap cleanup EXIT

pass() {
  PASS=$((PASS + 1))
  echo "  ✅ PASS: $1"
}

fail() {
  FAIL=$((FAIL + 1))
  echo "  ❌ FAIL: $1"
}

# --- Test cases ---

echo "TC-001: Description of test case"
# Setup, execute, assert
if [ "$result" = "expected" ]; then
  pass "TC-001"
else
  fail "TC-001: got $result"
fi

# --- Summary ---
echo ""
echo "Results: $PASS passed, $FAIL failed"
[ "$FAIL" -eq 0 ] || exit 1
```

### Writing a New Test

1. Create `plugins/rite/hooks/tests/your-hook.test.sh`
2. Follow the structure above: setup temporary directory, define `pass`/`fail` helpers, write test cases
3. Use `mktemp -d` for isolated test environments
4. Clean up with `trap cleanup EXIT`
5. Exit with code 1 if any test fails

The test runner (`run-tests.sh`) automatically discovers all `*.test.sh` files and reports aggregate results.

## Worktree Workflow

When working on parallel implementations, Rite Workflow supports `git worktree` to give each agent an independent working directory.

### Configuration

In `rite-config.yml`:

```yaml
parallel:
  enabled: true
  max_agents: 3
  mode: "worktree"           # "shared" (default) or "worktree"
  worktree_base: ".worktrees" # Base directory for worktrees
```

### How It Works

1. The orchestrator creates a branch for the Issue
2. For each parallel task, a worktree is created:
   ```bash
   git worktree add .worktrees/{issue}/{task} -b {branch}/{task} {branch}
   ```
3. Each agent works in its own worktree directory (Read/Edit/Write only, no git operations)
4. The orchestrator validates each worktree (tests + lint)
5. The orchestrator merges results: `git merge --no-ff {task-branch}`
6. Worktrees are cleaned up: `git worktree remove {path}`

### Important Constraints

- Only the orchestrator performs git operations (checkout, commit, merge, push)
- Agents use only file tools (Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep) within their worktree
- Add `.worktrees/` to `.gitignore` to prevent tracking worktree directories
- Check for stale worktrees from previous runs before creating new ones

### When to Use Worktree Mode

| Scenario | Recommended Mode |
|----------|-----------------|
| Tasks modify different files | `worktree` (safe parallel) |
| Tasks modify the same files | `shared` (sequential) |
| Single-task implementation | Either (no difference) |

For detailed patterns, see `plugins/rite/references/git-worktree-patterns.md`.
