# rite workflow - Pre-Tool Edit Guard (PreToolUse hook)
# Blocks reviewer subagents from mutating the parent working tree via the
# Edit / Write / MultiEdit / NotebookEdit tools.
#
# Why this exists (Issue #1860):
#   The sibling `pre-tool-bash-guard.sh` Pattern 4 only blocks state-mutating
#   *git* commands issued through the Bash tool — it does nothing about a
#   reviewer subagent that opens `Edit`/`Write` on a source file in the parent
#   working tree (observed in production: a reviewer edited an implementation
#   file in-place to run a mutation test, then hand-restored it). The prose ban
#   in `agents/_reviewer-base.md` alone does not stop LLM agents. This hook is
#   the structural enforcement layer for the Edit/Write side.
#
# Scope (all must hold to deny):
#   1. tool_name ∈ {Edit, Write, MultiEdit, NotebookEdit}
#   2. subagent context (reviewer) — same 3-tier detection as pre-tool-bash-guard.sh
#   3. the target's OWN git worktree (resolved by walking the target path up to its
#      nearest existing ancestor, then `git -C <ancestor> rev-parse`) is a real
#      parent working tree — i.e. its toplevel is NOT a sanctioned reviewer isolation
#      worktree (root named `rite-review-mutation-*` / `rite-revert-test-*`). Deciding
#      isolation on the resolved worktree root (not the raw path string) is what closes
#      the substring / `..` re-entry forgery found in review cycle 1. A write into a
#      .git directory of a non-isolation worktree also denies (review cycle 2:
#      .git/hooks/pre-commit etc. → main-session code execution). MultiEdit is included
#      even though Issue #1860's Technical Notes list only {Edit, Write, NotebookEdit}:
#      MultiEdit mutates files identically and omitting it would be a trivial bypass.
#
# Fail direction (mirrors pre-tool-bash-guard.sh Pattern 4):
#   - A crash BEFORE scope is confirmed (subagent + target resolved to a non-isolation
#     worktree / its .git dir) fails OPEN (exit 0 = allow) so a main-session Edit and a
#     genuine non-repo scratch write are never false-blocked.
#   - A crash AFTER scope is confirmed fails CLOSED (deny + exit 2) so a single
#     parse crash never silently bypasses the reviewer read-only guard.
#
# Exit behavior:
#   exit 0 — allow (no output)
#   stdout JSON with permissionDecision: "deny" — block
#
# hooks.json timeout: registered as PreToolUse (matcher Edit|Write|MultiEdit|
# NotebookEdit) with a 10s timeout — a fast synchronous gate using bash built-ins
# plus a couple of jq calls, aligned with the sibling lightweight gates.

# --- Reviewer subagent detection (3-tier) ---
# The detection LOGIC and the jq program below are the canonical copy from
# pre-tool-bash-guard.sh (Pattern 4) and are kept in sync with it: an intentional
# defense-in-depth duplication (a shared lib used by only two hooks would force a
# risky refactor of the heavily-pinned bash-guard). The `|| JQ_SA=$'\t\t'` fallback is a
# live silent-bypass path, NOT a formality: a valid-JSON envelope with a non-scalar
# `.transcript_path` (array/object) makes jq's @tsv fail at runtime, and the fallback
# then zeroes out Tier 1/2 → IS_SUBAGENT=0 → allow. So, exactly like the sibling, capture
# this jq's stderr and surface it under RITE_DEBUG so a detection-path drop is observable.
# (Do NOT add `| strings` to `.transcript_path` to swallow the error — that would diverge
# the jq program from the canonical copy and break the "keep in sync" contract.)
#   Tier 1 (primary):  transcript_path glob `*/subagents/*` — current Claude Code
#                      convention routing subagent sessions under a subagents/ dir.
#   Tier 2 (fallback): hook input JSON `subagent_type` / `agent_type` STRING field
#                      (numeric/array/object rejected via `| strings`).
#   Tier 3 (fallback): env vars CLAUDE_SUBAGENT_TYPE / CLAUDE_AGENT_TYPE (presence-only).
# Forward-compat caveat: presence-only fires on any non-empty string; if a future
# SDK emits sentinel values like "main"/"none" on main-session hooks this would
# false-positive — upgrade to an allow-list glob (e.g. `*-reviewer`) at that point.
