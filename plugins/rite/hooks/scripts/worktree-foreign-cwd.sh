# worktree-foreign-cwd.sh — self-exclusion-aware live-cwd probe for cleanup.md
# ステップ 4-W.
#
# Answers a single question: "is a FOREIGN (non-self) live process standing in
# this worktree (cwd at it or nested under it)?" — i.e. the same OS-ground-truth
# question as worktree-live-cwd.sh, but with the cleanup session's OWN process
# tree excluded.
#
# Why this exists (Issue #1670):
#   cleanup.md ステップ 4-W removes the session worktree it just finished with. It
#   first calls ExitWorktree(keep), which retreats the harness cwd back to the
#   main checkout — after that, the plain worktree-live-cwd.sh probe reports rc=1
#   and removal proceeds. But when ExitWorktree was a no-op (the worktree was
#   path-entered WITHOUT an EnterWorktree session record — the #1622
#   in_worktree_unrecorded case — or a resume re-entry), the harness cwd stays
#   inside the worktree, so the plain probe reports rc=0 and cleanup DEFERS the
#   removal — blocking on the very session that is running cleanup (self-blocking).
#   pr-cycle-cleanup.sh Step 5 already avoids this for the lazy reaper via its
#   Gate 0 self-exclusion; this helper gives cleanup.md the same self-exclusion
#   WITHOUT modifying worktree-live-cwd.sh (its OS detection method is unchanged —
#   #1670 Non-Target §4.2). The caller passes --self-root (its harness pid); every
#   process in that pid subtree is "self" and ignored, so only a genuine OTHER
#   session standing in the tree defers the removal (Issue #1670 AC-3).
#
# Usage:
#   worktree-foreign-cwd.sh <dir> --self-root <pid>
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = a FOREIGN live process has cwd == <dir> or nested under it → caller DEFERS
#   1 = no foreign live cwd (only the self pid-subtree, or nobody) → caller REMOVES
#   2 = cannot determine (no /proc, or bad arguments) → caller decides. cleanup.md
#       removes on rc=2, matching the pre-#1670 worktree-live-cwd.sh rc=2
#       backward-compat behavior (so non-/proc hosts behave exactly as before).
#
# Portability: /proc only (Linux). Without /proc (e.g. macOS) returns 2 — the
# self-exclusion degrades to "remove" exactly as the old rc=2 path did, so there
# is no regression vs the previous behavior on those hosts. macOS bash 3.2 floor
# is preserved (no associative arrays, no GNU realpath); shared with
# pr-cycle-cleanup.sh / worktree-live-cwd.sh.
