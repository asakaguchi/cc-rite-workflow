# Functional regression test for corrupt/orphaned .rite/wiki-worktree recovery.
#
# Reproduces the silent raw-source accumulation stall (Issue #1662): when the
# repository is relocated/copied, the wiki worktree's `.git` file keeps a stale
# `gitdir:` pointer to the old path, leaving `.rite/wiki-worktree` as a directory
# that exists on disk but is NOT a registered worktree. Before the fix:
#   - wiki-ingest-commit.sh hit `verify_worktree_branch ... || exit 1` and
#     hard-stopped (non-blocking upstream, so nobody saw the WARNING).
#   - wiki-worktree-setup.sh could not recover it either (`git worktree add`
#     aborts with "already exists" on the orphaned directory).
# Both scripts now self-heal. Unlike the sibling static-pin tests, this builds a
# real git fixture so the recovery cannot silently regress.
