# rite workflow - Cross-Session Legacy Guard Helper (private internal helper)
#
# Inspects a legacy `.rite-flow-state` file relative to a current session_id
# and classifies the cross-session takeover/fallback decision. The writer and
# reader state resolvers that shared this classification were consolidated into
# flow-state.sh, so this helper currently has no live caller — it is retained as
# the canonical classification contract for any future re-wiring.
#
# Usage:
#   bash plugins/rite/hooks/_resolve-cross-session-guard.sh \
#     <legacy_path> <current_sid>
#
# Outputs (single token to stdout):
#   "same"                  legacy.session_id == current_sid → safe to take over
#   "empty"                 legacy.session_id is null/missing → safe (sessionless legacy)
#   "foreign:<other_sid>"   legacy.session_id != current_sid → refuse take-over
#   "corrupt:<jq_rc>"       legacy file jq parse failed → refuse take-over (cannot verify)
#   "invalid_uuid:1"        legacy.session_id JSON-parseable but UUID validation failed
#                           → refuse take-over (tampered / legacy schema with non-UUID session_id)
#                           Distinct from "corrupt:*" so a consumer can differentiate
#                           UUID validation failure from jq parse failure.
#
# Why this exists (verified-review cycle 34 fix F-02 HIGH):
#   The same `legacy.session_id` extraction + comparison logic was duplicated
#   between writer-side `_resolve_session_state_path` and reader-side state-read.sh
#   per-session resolver. DRY-ifying eliminates the drift risk where a future
#   tightening of the comparison (e.g., variant-bit equivalence, normalization)
#   is applied to one side only — the root cause was a writer-side guard
#   that the reader-side did not yet mirror (cycle 32 added writer, cycle 33
#   added reader).
#
# Caller responsibility (no live caller today — see above):
#   A consumer of these classifications would route each one and surface the
#   non-adoptable cases as a plain WARNING on stderr:
#   - "same" / "empty" → adopt legacy as the resolved STATE_FILE
#   - "foreign:<sid>" → cross-session takeover refused; route to per-session path
#                       (writer) or DEFAULT (reader)
#   - "corrupt:<rc>" → legacy state corrupt; route to per-session path (writer) or
#                       DEFAULT (reader)
#   - "invalid_uuid:<rc>" → legacy state corrupt (reason=invalid_uuid_format),
#                       distinct classification for diagnosis
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — always (classification printed to stdout)

# Stderr is intentionally kept clean here. Callers historically combined
# stdout/stderr with `2>&1` to capture diagnostics, but that merged any `jq:`
# parse-error text into the `classification` string and broke the
# `case ... corrupt:*) ...` match, silently routing to the defensive `*)` arm
# and suppressing the legacy-state-corrupt WARNING. The current contract: callers use
# `2>/dev/null` and observe the rc via `corrupt:N`; full jq stderr is captured
# by each caller into its own tempfile (see `_jq_err` capture blocks in the
# caller hooks). Drift history is in references/state-read-evolution.md.
