## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.2] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **`/rite:init --upgrade` short-circuit path no longer drops drift back-adds** (#1461) — when no pending drift was detected, the `--upgrade` short-circuit path skipped the back-add step that the full path performs, so projects taking the short-circuit could miss newly added config sections and sub-keys. The short-circuit now applies the same drift back-add logic, covered by an added drift-detection test.
- **Fixed broken references to the non-existent `_resolve-flow-state-path.sh`** (#1466) — updated stale script references in the hooks documentation to the actual `flow-state.sh` path.

### Changed

- **Unified flow state on the per-session model** (#1460) — removed the legacy `flow_state.schema_version=1` (single-file) path from the hooks (`session-start`, `session-end`, `post-compact`, `pre-compact`, `post-tool-wm-sync`), `init.md`, and the config template, consolidating on per-session flow state. Stale `schema_version` test fixtures/labels were neutralized (#1465), `commit.contextual` was added to the SPEC Deprecated key list (#1469), and `SPEC.md` / `getting-started.md` were updated to follow the `--upgrade` drift back-add behavior change (#1467).

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **`/rite:init --upgrade` now converges to the latest config defaults** (#1447) — the `--upgrade` path previously dropped newly added top-level sections, new sub-keys inside existing sections, and the `multi_session` block, producing a two-tier behavior where upgraded projects drifted from what a fresh `/rite:init` produces. `--upgrade` now back-adds `multi_session` with `enabled: true` (an explicit `false` is preserved; idempotent), fills only the missing sub-keys from the template default while preserving existing sibling values, and tracks newly added top-level sections via a drift anchor. Covered by a new sub-key-merge drift-detection test (T-12, #1451), which was unified onto the shared `_test-helpers.sh` harness (#1453). `commands/getting-started.md` documents the `--upgrade` `multi_session` back-add behavior (#1452).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Session worktrees for work isolation** — `multi_session` configuration with session-scoped worktree creation via `EnterWorktree`, resume re-entry, and lazy reap on cleanup. Default ON (opt-in → default).
- **Issue claim mechanism** (`issue-claim.sh`) — fail-fast guard preventing two sessions from working the same Issue concurrently.
- **`/rite:learn`** — Socratic understanding-check command for completed Issue/PR sessions.
- **Assumption Surfacing step** in `/rite:issue:create` — surfaces implicit model assumptions and classifies them (derive / ask / defer).
- **Knowledge routing (4-channel)** added to coding principles, with comment why-over-what and rejected-alternative routing.
- **Review scope classification** — `scope` / `pre_existing` / `acknowledged` fields (review-result-schema 1.1.0), 3-way recommendation disposition, and a Phase 7 post-condition gate.
- **Wiki lint helper scripts** for the three machine-decidable categories, plus concurrent-ingest exclusion (session lock + push retry).
- **New `/rite:lint` guards** — hardcoded line-number drift, CLOSED+COMPLETED board-not-Done drift, and operational bash-block heaviness.
- Artifacts schema 1.1.0 migration script + version-drift hook.

### Changed

- `multi_session.enabled` now defaults to `true` for new projects.
- Numerous Source-of-Truth consolidations across commands, references, and templates (Type crosswalk, contract section mapping, etc.).
- Reviewer base / severity-levels gained Scope Assignment responsibility.

### Fixed

- Extensive stabilization across the review-fix loop, hooks (flow-state multi-state API, legacy `.rite-flow-state` migration, bang-backtick guard, drift-check), Issue/PR orchestration, and Wiki ingest/query (300+ fixes consolidated since v0.4.0).

> This is a large consolidation release (644 commits since v0.4.0). Entries are summarized at the feature level per the project's CHANGELOG policy.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-22

### BREAKING CHANGE

- **Cycle-count-based review-fix degradation fully abolished; replaced by 4 quality signals** — **BREAKING CHANGE** (#557)
  - **Removed configuration keys** (three keys from `rite-config.yml`; these keys were never present in `plugins/rite/templates/config/rite-config.yml`):
    - `review.loop.severity_gating_cycle_threshold`
    - `review.loop.scope_lock_cycle_threshold`
    - `safety.max_review_fix_loops`
  - **Removed logic**:
    - `plugins/rite/commands/pr/references/fix-relaxation-rules.md` convergence strategy override table (`severity_gating` / `scope_lock` / `batched` as strategies) and Loop Termination hard-limit row.
    - `plugins/rite/commands/pr/fix.md` Phase 0.4 Convergence Strategy Load (the full block loading `convergence_strategy` from `.rite-flow-state`).
    - `plugins/rite/commands/issue/start.md` Phase 5.4.6 Step 3.5 Review-Fix Loop Hard Limit Check (the `extend (+5) / retry / escalate` 3-choice dialog).
    - `plugins/rite/commands/issue/start.md` Phase 5.4.1.0 cycle-trajectory pattern analysis (Converging / Stalled / Diverging / Oscillating) and the `convergence_strategy` write to `.rite-flow-state`.
  - **New behavior**: the review-fix loop now has exactly two exit paths — (a) 0 findings → `[review:mergeable]`, or (b) any of the **four quality signals** fires → `AskUserQuestion` escalation (`本 PR 内で再試行 / 別 Issue として切り出す / PR を取り下げる / 手動レビューへエスカレーション`).
  - **Four quality signals**:
    1. Same-finding cycling — detected in `start.md` Phase 5.4.1.0 via SHA-1 fingerprints of `file + category + normalized message`. One re-occurrence escalates.
    2. Root-cause-missing fix — detected in `fix.md` Phase 3.2.1 by an LLM-semantic check of the commit body for a `root-cause(scope):` action line (new Contextual Commits action type), a `decision(scope):` line that explicitly names the root cause, or a free-form `Root cause:` / `根本原因:` paragraph. Missing → `AskUserQuestion` 3-option prompt.
    3. Cross-validation disagreement — detected in `review.md` Phase 5.2 when two reviewers report the same `file:line` with severity gap ≥ 2 and debate fails to resolve.
    4. Finding quality gate failure — new `Finding Quality Guardrail` in `_reviewer-base.md` filters bikeshedding / defensive / hypothetical / style-only findings before output; if nothing remains, reviewer self-reports as "degraded" via a `### Reviewer self-assessment` section and escalates.
  - **Finding fingerprint specification**: `sha1(normalize(file_path) + ":" + category + ":" + normalize(message))` with identifier masking and Jaccard token similarity > 0.7 for near-match detection. See `start.md` Phase 5.4.1.0 for the full spec.
  - **Minor version bump**: 0.3.10 → 0.4.0 (6 version files synchronized).
  - **Removed-key handling**: The three removed keys are silently ignored at runtime. There is no `/rite:lint` deprecation scan or warning for them.
  - **No cycle-count safety limit (by design)**: There is intentionally no hidden iteration guard. The 4 quality signals are the sole termination mechanism. Reintroducing an iteration counter would contradict the core goal of this release (removing cycle-count-based degradation).

### Migration guide

Existing users with any of the following in `rite-config.yml` should remove those lines:

```yaml
# Remove all three:
review:
  loop:
    severity_gating_cycle_threshold: 5
    scope_lock_cycle_threshold: 7
safety:
  max_review_fix_loops: 7
```

The keys are silently ignored at runtime in v0.4.0. There is no functional replacement — non-convergence is now detected automatically by the four quality signals and no cycle-count threshold needs to be configured.

If you previously relied on `max_review_fix_loops` hitting a hard limit to escape runaway loops, the same safety is now provided by Quality Signal 1 (fingerprint cycling) which fires on the **second** occurrence of any finding — typically faster than any cycle-count threshold would have tripped.

### Changed

- **Review-Fix Cycle Overhaul (Fail-Fast Response + Separate Issue user confirmation + configuration layer)** — **BREAKING CHANGE** (finalizes the #502 rollout, which began with #507 principles doc layer, #508/#504 reviewer exit layer, and #509 Fact-Check layer). Wires the `fix` response layer and configuration layer to the previously-merged principle/exit/fact-check layers.
  - `plugins/rite/commands/pr/fix.md` Phase 2 now begins with a **Fail-Fast Response Principle** section enforcing a 4-item checklist (`throw/raise` propagation / existing error boundaries / not hiding via null-checks / fix the test instead) before deciding a fix approach. Adopting a fallback requires an explicit justification in the commit message; unthinking defensive code is re-flagged at Phase 5 re-review.
  - `plugins/rite/commands/pr/fix.md` Phase 4.3.3 **removes the E2E `AskUserQuestion` skip** — separate-issue creation is now gated by user confirmation **regardless** of caller (E2E `/rite:issue:start` loop or standalone). Options are unified to `retry in current PR / create separate issue / withdraw`, all of which converge to `findings == 0` so the review-fix loop still terminates.
  - `plugins/rite/commands/pr/fix.md` and `plugins/rite/commands/issue/start.md`: the `"severity_gating"` convergence strategy has been **removed**. All PR-originating findings must be addressed within the current PR regardless of severity (本 PR 完結原則). `rite-config.yml` `fix.severity_gating.enabled` is retained as a deprecated compatibility key pinned to `false`. Non-convergence is now handled via the unified `AskUserQuestion` route in fix.md Phase 4.3.3. Use `"batched"` or `"scope_lock"` strategy for non-convergence mitigation instead.
  - `plugins/rite/templates/config/rite-config.yml` adds **config scaffolding keys** (declaration only, runtime wiring tracked as a follow-up): `review.observed_likelihood_gate.*`, `review.fail_fast_first.*`, `review.separate_issue_creation.*`, `fix.fail_fast_response`. The `fix.severity_gating.enabled: false` key is retained as a deprecated compatibility shim and is actively honored (pinned to `false`). **Known limitation**: The non-deprecation scaffolding keys (`observed_likelihood_gate`, `fail_fast_first`, `separate_issue_creation`, `fail_fast_response`) are **not yet referenced by conditional runtime logic** in `commands/` / `agents/` / `skills/` / `hooks/`. The new behavior (Fail-Fast Response Principle, always-confirm separate-issue creation) is hardcoded in `fix.md` Phase 2 / Phase 4.3.3 prose and cannot currently be disabled via config. These keys are provided so users can see the intended configuration surface; wiring them to conditional branches is tracked as a follow-up Issue.
  - `plugins/rite/i18n/{ja,en}/pr.yml` adds four i18n message keys (`review_fail_fast_first_warning`, `review_observed_likelihood_demotion_notice`, `review_separate_issue_user_confirmation_question`, `fix_fail_fast_response_checklist_prompt`) with ja/en parity. **Known limitation**: these keys are **not yet referenced** via the `{i18n:key_name}` lookup in `commands/` / `skills/` / `agents/`. The corresponding prompts in `fix.md` / `review.md` currently embed their text directly. Call-site wiring is tracked as a follow-up.
  - **Migration guide**: Existing users with `fix.severity_gating.enabled: true` in `rite-config.yml` will find the key silently pinned to `false`. Non-convergence is now resolved via the `retry in current PR / create separate issue / withdraw` `AskUserQuestion` at fix.md Phase 4.3.3. Users who relied on automatic severity-based deferral should adopt `"batched"` or `"scope_lock"` strategy. **Opt-out limitation**: the other new config keys (`observed_likelihood_gate`, `fail_fast_first`, `separate_issue_creation`) are **not yet actionable as opt-outs** — the new behavior is currently enforced unconditionally in the prose. To disable any of these, the corresponding prompt sections in `fix.md` / `review.md` must be edited directly until the wiring PR lands. (#506)

- **Named subagent invocation for `/rite:pr:review` reviewers** — **BREAKING CHANGE**. `plugins/rite/commands/pr/review.md` now invokes reviewer agents via `subagent_type: "rite:{reviewer_type}-reviewer"` (scoped named subagent) instead of `subagent_type: general-purpose`. Under named subagent invocation, each reviewer's agent file body (`plugins/rite/agents/{reviewer_type}-reviewer.md`) becomes the sub-agent's **system prompt** automatically, and YAML frontmatter (`model`, `tools`) is honored by the runtime. This gives reviewer discipline stronger system-prompt-level enforcement (rather than user-prompt injection which can be diluted) and activates per-reviewer model pins (9 reviewers pinned to `model: opus`). A reviewer_type → subagent_type mapping table was added for the 13 reviewers. Empirical verification (Issue #356) confirmed that the `rite:` prefix is mandatory in plugin distribution — bare `{reviewer_type}-reviewer` fails agent resolution with `Agent type not found` error. **User impact**: users previously running reviews on sonnet will see forced opus upgrade for 9 reviewers and a corresponding cost increase (opt-out by removing `model: opus` from individual agent frontmatters). See `docs/migration-guides/review-named-subagent.md` for the full migration guide, opus recommendation rationale, and 3 rollback scenarios (all-reviewer resolution failure / tech-writer Bash permission / verification mode output format broken) (#358)
- **`{agent_identity}` placeholder renamed to `{shared_reviewer_principles}` in `review.md`** — **BREAKING CHANGE** (for rite plugin developers editing `review.md` templates). `review.md` now extracts only the shared reviewer principles from `_reviewer-base.md` (Reviewer Mindset / Cross-File Impact Check / Confidence Scoring). Part B (agent-specific identity) extraction was removed entirely — it is no longer needed because the named subagent system prompt delivers agent-specific discipline directly. This is a **hybrid approach**: agent body → system prompt (via named subagent), shared principles → user prompt (via `{shared_reviewer_principles}`). The alternative (inlining shared principles into 13 agent files) was rejected to preserve `_reviewer-base.md` as the single source of truth. The review template sections `## あなたのアイデンティティと検出プロセス` were renamed to `## 共通レビュー原則` to reflect the narrower scope. Preserves the #357 Part A bug fix that ensures Cross-File Impact Check reaches reviewers (#358)
- **Retry classification extended with `subagent resolution failure` in `review.md`** — Added a new retry classification entry for the case where the Task tool cannot resolve a scoped subagent name (e.g., `Agent type 'rite:code-quality-reviewer' not found. Available agents: ...`). Retry: **No**. Action: fail immediately with the scoped name used and the error message. Do NOT silently fall back to `general-purpose` — that would defeat the named subagent quality improvement. If all reviewers fail this way, the orchestrator prompts the user via `AskUserQuestion` (retry / rollback to `general-purpose` temporarily / abort review). Classification detection pattern: Task tool response contains `Agent type '{scoped_name}' not found` (#358)

- **docs: reflect v0.4.0+ implementation across SPEC / README / CLAUDE.md / CHANGELOG** — Multi-PR documentation alignment sweep after v0.4.0:
  - Commands table + Agent File Format Note — added `/rite:issue:recall` to README / README.ja / SPEC / SPEC.ja Commands tables, added `/rite:init --upgrade` to README.ja, replaced the `subagent_type: general-purpose` note with the named-subagent description (#637 / #638)
  - SPEC Plugin Structure tree refreshed to match v0.4.0+ file layout (commands/issue sub-skills, commands/pr/references, commands/wiki, agents/_reviewer-base, skills/{investigate,wiki}, hooks/{scripts,tests}, templates/{config,review,wiki}, scripts expansion, references expansion); Configuration section compressed to a pointer to `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`; Hook Specification extended with post-compact / phase-transition-whitelist / verify-terminal-output (removed in #1079) / session-ownership / issue-comment-wm-sync / wiki-ingest-trigger + wiki-query-inject / workflow-incident-emit / hook-preamble / helper-scripts sub-sections (#639 / #640)
  - CLAUDE.md architecture diagram refreshed; `docs/BEST_PRACTICES_ALIGNMENT.md` archived under `docs/archive/` as historical v0.1–v0.3 reference (#641 / #642)
  - CHANGELOG Unreleased populated with post-v0.4.0 develop activity (#643 / #644)
  - Repo-wide version rename 1.0.0 → 0.4.0 (next release planned as v0.4.0 not v1.0.0); version files, README badges, CHANGELOG [1.0.0] entry → [0.4.0], and internal `v1.0.0 (#557)` references updated (#645)
- **Bidirectional backlink format unified to colon notation** across `commands/` — `refactor(commands)` aligning Wiki cross-reference style project-wide (#620 / #626), and extending existing DRIFT-CHECK ANCHOR blocks in `wiki/ingest.md` / `wiki/lint.md` with bidirectional backlink entries (#607 / #619).
- **Semantic anchor migration** — replaced residual hard-coded line-number literals in `commands/init.md:145` and `hooks/scripts/gitignore-health-check.sh:298` with semantic anchors resilient to future edits (#617).
- **`/rite:wiki:lint` `--auto` early-return alignment** — Phase 1.1 / 1.3 early-return paths aligned with the Phase 9.2 three-piece convention so sentinel / status-line / continuation-hint emission is uniform (#630 / #632).
- **Wiki skill polish** — `skills/wiki/SKILL.md` EN description aligned with its canonical form (#603 / #616); `wiki/lint.md` completion-report UX output order aligned with the canonical frontmatter order (#615).

### Added

- **Workflow incident auto-registration mechanism** — `/rite:issue:start` now auto-detects workflow blockers (Skill load failure, hook abnormal exit, manual fallback adoption) and registers them as Issues to prevent silent loss. New `plugins/rite/hooks/workflow-incident-emit.sh` emits sentinel patterns (`[CONTEXT] WORKFLOW_INCIDENT=1; type=...; details=...; iteration_id=...`) from skill internal failure paths and orchestrator fallback prompts. New workflow incident detection logic in `start.md` detects sentinels via context grep, presents `AskUserQuestion` for confirmation, and calls the existing `create-issue-with-projects.sh` with `Status: Todo / Priority: High / Complexity: S / source: workflow_incident`. Same-type incidents are deduplicated within a session. Failure to register is non-blocking. Default-on via new `workflow_incident:` config section (set `enabled: false` to opt out). 11 unit tests added under `plugins/rite/hooks/tests/workflow-incident-emit.test.sh`. Implements all 10 ACs from #366 (Skill load failure / hook abnormal exit / manual fallback adoption detection, dedupe, default-on, opt-out, recommendation-flow non-interference, non-blocking error handling). Driven by the meta-incident demonstrated in PR #363 cycle 1, where Skill loader bug #365 was silently bypassed via Edit-tool fallback (#366)
- **tech-writer Critical Checklist concretized** — Added 5 doc-implementation consistency items: `Implementation Coverage`, `Enumeration Completeness`, `UX Flow Accuracy`, `Order-Emphasis Consistency`, and `Screenshot Presence`. Each item carries a verification method (Grep/Read/Glob), and 3 new sample rows have been added to the Prohibited vs Required Findings table sourced from an internal documentation-centric PR case study (private repository, organization name redacted) (#349)
- **internal-consistency.md reference** — New reference file that complements `fact-check.md` (external specs) with an internal-facts verification protocol. Defines 5 Verification Protocol categories, Confidence 80+ gate, severity mapping, and a Cross-Reference section linking it to `tech-writer.md`, `review.md`, and related agent files (#349)
- **Doc-Heavy PR Detection** — Automatic detection of documentation-centric PRs in `review.md` (formula: `(doc_lines / total_diff_lines >= 0.6)` OR `(doc_files_count / total_files_count >= 0.7 AND total_diff_lines < 2000)`). Excludes rite plugin's own `commands/`, `skills/`, `agents/` `.md` files **and `.md` / `.mdx` translation documentation under `plugins/rite/i18n/**`** (prompt-engineer territory / dogfooding artifacts; non-Markdown translation resources such as `.yml` / `.json` / `.po` under `plugins/rite/i18n/` are not part of the `doc_file_patterns` numerator in the first place, so the exclusion is a no-op for them). Added optional schema `review.doc_heavy.*` (keys: `enabled`, `lines_ratio_threshold`, `count_ratio_threshold`, `max_diff_lines_for_count`) to `rite-config.yml` (#349)
- **Doc-Heavy Reviewer Override** — When `{doc_heavy_pr == true}`, promote tech-writer from recommended to mandatory and add code-quality as co-reviewer through one of three independent paths so the final state always has ≥2 reviewers:
  - **Normal path**: Add code-quality when fenced code blocks (` ```bash ` / ` ```yaml ` / ` ```python ` etc.) are detected in the diff. Pure-prose PRs do **not** trigger this path.
  - **Fail-safe path**: When the diff scan itself fails (`git diff` IO error, grep IO error, etc.), code-quality is added regardless of whether fenced blocks were detected, to preserve verification strength when the detection signal is unavailable.
  - **Fallback path**: When no fenced blocks are detected and the Doc-Heavy override produced no addition, the sole-reviewer guard adds code-quality as a fallback in the next phase.

  Passes `{doc_heavy_pr=true}` flag to tech-writer to activate the 5-category verification protocol defined in `internal-consistency.md` (Implementation Coverage / Enumeration Completeness / UX Flow Accuracy / Order-Emphasis Consistency / Screenshot Presence), makes the `Evidence:` line mandatory on each finding, and triggers the Doc-Heavy post-condition check in `review.md` (#349)
- **`/rite:pr:fix` accepts PR URL / comment URL directly** — `/rite:pr:fix` now accepts PR URL or comment URL arguments in addition to PR number, allowing findings from external review tools (e.g. `/verified-review`) to be parsed directly into the fix loop. Accepted URL formats include trailing paths (`/files`), query strings (`?tab=files`), and fragment identifiers (`#diff-...`) — all are normalized on argument ingest. Comments must contain a markdown table with at least 4 columns (with optional 5th `confidence` column). See `plugins/rite/commands/pr/fix.md` argument-parsing sections for the full argument spec, header detection keywords, and severity alias mapping (#349)
- **`[fix:pushed-wm-stale]` output pattern** — `/rite:pr:fix` now emits `[fix:pushed-wm-stale]` when the work memory update soft-failed. Firing conditions map 1:1 to the reason table in `commands/pr/fix.md` — each natural-language phrase below annotates its corresponding `reason` label. See the reason table for the complete list of `reason` values:
  - `current_body` empty → `current_body_empty`
  - `issue_number` not found → `issue_number_not_found`
  - PATCH 4xx/5xx → `patch_failed`
  - `pr_body` grep IO error → `pr_body_grep_io_error` (+ `mktemp_failed_pr_body_grep_err` for its stderr tempfile)
  - branch grep IO error → `branch_grep_io_error` (+ `mktemp_failed_branch_grep_err`)
  - `gh api comments` fetch failure → `gh_api_comments_fetch_failed` (+ `mktemp_failed_gh_api_err`)
  - Python script unexpected exit (generic) → `python_unexpected_exit_$py_exit`
  - `git diff` failure (Python sentinel detection) → `python_sentinel_detected` (reserved exclusively for `GIT_DIFF_FAILED_SENTINEL` match via `sys.exit(2)`)
  - work memory body corruption detected → `wm_body_empty_or_too_short` / `wm_header_missing` / `wm_body_too_small`
  - mktemp failure → `mktemp_failed_*` family (`mktemp_failed_pr_body_tmp`, `mktemp_failed_body_tmp`, `mktemp_failed_tmpfile`, `mktemp_failed_files_tmp`, `mktemp_failed_history_tmp`, `mktemp_failed_diff_stderr_tmp`, etc.)

  The `git diff` failure path also routes through `WM_UPDATE_FAILED=1; reason=python_sentinel_detected` (via Python `sys.exit(2)` and bash `exit 1`). The bash `exit 1` only kills the current bash invocation, but the retained `WM_UPDATE_FAILED=1` flag survives in the conversation context — the soft-failure evaluation still runs, detects the flag via row 2 of the evaluation-order table, and emits `[fix:pushed-wm-stale]` (NOT `[fix:error]`). The hard fail-fast design ensures the PATCH is silently rejected, but the `[fix:pushed-wm-stale]` output pattern is the correct caller-facing signal (see `commands/pr/fix.md` evaluation order and `reason` table for the authoritative flow). Callers (`/rite:issue:start` review-fix loop) **must not** silently treat `[fix:pushed-wm-stale]` as `[fix:pushed]`; instead, they must surface a warning via `AskUserQuestion` and let the user decide whether to continue with stale work memory or pause for manual recovery. See `commands/pr/fix.md` caller semantics for the full contract (#349)
- **Bidirectional backlink format verification in `/rite:lint`** — `/rite:lint` now mechanically verifies that Wiki pages maintain bidirectional backlink references in the canonical colon-delimited form. Runs as a non-blocking structural drift check in Phase 3.x and surfaces mismatches in the final report (#627 / #631).

### Fixed

- **`wiki-query-inject.sh` origin/wiki fallback** — `/rite:wiki:query` now reads Wiki content via `origin/{wiki_branch}` when the local `wiki` branch does not exist (fresh clone / separate worktree). Previously `git show "${wiki_branch}:.rite/wiki/index.md"` used the bare branch name and failed with `fatal: invalid object name 'wiki'` when only `origin/wiki` was available locally, causing `/rite:wiki:query` to silently return empty context after `/rite:pr:cleanup` on another worktree. Uses the same ref-selection pattern as `cleanup.md` Phase 4.W.1 Step 2 and `wiki-growth-check.sh`. Negative case (neither local nor origin) continues to emit the existing `WARNING: wiki branch not found` and exit 0 (non-blocking). Also adds `wiki_ingest_push_failed` sentinel emission to `cleanup.md` Phase 4.W.3 when `wiki-worktree-commit.sh` reports `push=failed` (rc=4 path inside ingest), so `origin/wiki` divergence becomes observable in the incident layer while preserving loss-safe cleanup continuation. Additionally restores the `wiki_ingest_push_failed` incident type that `plugins/rite/hooks/workflow-incident-emit.sh` was missing from its `--type` whitelist — all existing callers in `pr/review.md`, `pr/fix.md`, and `issue/close.md` that emit this type were silently falling through to the `hook_abnormal_exit` fallback branch, so the dedicated `wiki_ingest_push_failed` sentinel defined in `issue/start.md` ステップ 8.5 (PR #1079 で旧 Phase 5.4.4.1 を統合) was never actually emitted in practice since PR #529 (#555)
- **Part A extraction bug in `review.md`** — Fixed Part A section extraction from `_reviewer-base.md` that was dropping `## Cross-File Impact Check` (everything between `## Reviewer Mindset` and `## Confidence Scoring`). Extraction now covers all sections from document start to `## Input` heading (exclusive), enabling the 5 mandatory cross-file consistency checks (deleted/renamed exports, changed config keys, changed interface contracts, i18n key consistency, keyword list consistency) to actually reach reviewer agents for the first time (#357)
- **tools/model frontmatter drift in reviewer agents** — Removed `tools:` frontmatter from all 13 reviewer agents (`api`, `code-quality`, `database`, `dependencies`, `devops`, `error-handling`, `frontend`, `performance`, `prompt-engineer`, `security`, `tech-writer`, `test`, `type-design`) and `model: sonnet` from 4 reviewers (`code-quality`, `error-handling`, `performance`, `type-design`). Previously these fields were ignored at runtime (reviewers are invoked via `subagent_type: general-purpose`), but would have silently broken when the named subagent migration completes (tech-writer would lose Bash and break Doc-Heavy PR Mode; 4 reviewers would regress to sonnet for opus users). The 9 remaining reviewers retain `model: opus` as an explicit high-quality review pin (intentionally kept; opus was already the runtime-effective model and removing the pin would have regressed them to session default which may be sonnet). Related `docs/SPEC.md` / `docs/SPEC.ja.md` Agent File Format section updated to mark `tools` as optional (inherit) and the Current Agents table updated to reflect the 4 reviewers as `inherit` (#357)
- **Verification-mode post-condition check added** — `review.md` now adds a post-condition check (child of the Verification Mode Findings Collection logic) that validates each reviewer in `verification` mode emits the `### 修正検証結果` table. On initial detection, a per-reviewer retry (via the reviewer invocation Task tool) is attempted with strict verification template instructions; on persistent absence, `verification_post_condition: error` is set, the overall assessment is promoted to `修正必要` (unified with the escalation chain labels — `要修正` is a reviewer-level label and is not used for overall assessment promotion), and all findings from the non-compliant reviewer are treated as blocking. Classification vocabulary is `passed` / `warning` / `error` (unified with `doc_heavy_post_condition`). Retained flags `verification_post_condition` and `verification_post_condition_retry_count` (per-reviewer dict) are registered in the retained flags list and displayed in the verification mode template. Prevents silent pass when a reviewer skips verification output (#357)
- **`commands/pr/fix.md` reason-table drift** — Expanded the `reason` table to cover all 28 `WM_UPDATE_FAILED` reasons actually emitted in the work memory update paths (previously only 12 were listed, 16 were missing). The eval-order table row 2 now defers to "reason 表のいずれか" instead of enumerating a subset, eliminating the double-drift problem. DoD verification (manually executed): `comm -3 <(grep -oE 'WM_UPDATE_FAILED=1; reason=[a-z_][a-z_0-9]*' plugins/rite/commands/pr/fix.md | sed 's/.*reason=//' | sort -u) <(awk '/^\*\*`reason` フィールド/{in_table=1;next} in_table && /^\*\*/{in_table=0} in_table && /^\| `[a-z_]/{match($0, /`[a-z_][a-z_0-9]*[^`]*`/); print substr($0, RSTART+1, RLENGTH-2)}' plugins/rite/commands/pr/fix.md | sed 's/\$.*//' | sort -u)` returns empty (28 WM_UPDATE_FAILED reasons in emits exactly match the 28 entries in the reason table). The awk pattern is scoped to the `**\`reason\` フィールド` section to avoid false positives from other tables in `fix.md` (#357, absorbed from PR #350 C2)
- **Sub-skill return implicit-stop multi-layer defense** — Accumulated fixes (#534 / #628 / #618 / #621 / #604 / #634) hardening the sub-skill return → orchestrator continuation path against Bash heuristic-induced implicit stops. Covers `create-interview`, `wiki/ingest.md` Phase 8 auto-lint, `pr/cleanup` wiki-ingest return, and `pr/cleanup` wiki-auto-ingest Phase 5 boundaries. Includes `INTERVIEW_DONE=1` plain-text marker (#634 / #636) and `stop-guard.sh` case-arm `WORKFLOW_HINT` expansion with Step 0 Immediate Bash Action.
- **`wiki/lint.md` Phase 9.2 `--auto` continuation sentinel** — `--auto` output now emits an explicit continuation sentinel so callers can distinguish completed-with-warnings from silent-skip (#625 / #629).
- **`pr/cleanup` completion message trailing blank line** — Removed the spurious trailing blank line after the "次のステップ" heading for cleaner terminal rendering (#633 / #635).
- **Preprocessor-safe syntax migration in `wiki/` and `pr/cleanup`** — Residual `!`+backtick expressions that the slash-command preprocessor evaluated via bash (causing `slash command not found` failures) were migrated to the `if ! cmd; then` form per the convention documented in #613 (#609 / #610, #611 / #612, #614).
