# Tests for 4-site bash literal symmetry across the create-interview workflow
# (Issue #771 / parent #768 P4-12)
#
# Purpose:
#   The /rite:issue:create workflow maintains symmetric bash literals
#   (`flow-state-update.sh patch --phase X --active true --next "..." --preserve-error-count`)
#   across multiple sites that must stay in lockstep. Past incidents
#   (#525 / #552 / #561 / #622 / #634 / #651 / #660) have repeatedly shown that
#   片肺更新 drift in any one site causes either:
#     - error_count reset loop (verified-review cycle 3 F-01) when --preserve-error-count
#       is dropped from one occurrence
#     - active=false residue causing stop-guard early return (Issue #660) when --active true
#       is dropped
#
#   The canonical anchor is the "DRIFT-CHECK ANCHOR (semantic, 4-site)" comment
#   in `commands/issue/create.md` which enumerates the 4 sites:
#     (1) create.md 🚨 Mandatory After Interview Step 0
#     (2) create-interview.md 🚨 MANDATORY Pre-flight
#     (3) create-interview.md Return Output re-patch
#     (4) stop-guard.sh `create_post_interview` case arm WORKFLOW_HINT
#
# Scope adjustment for current implementation (per Issue #771 R1/R2 mitigation):
#   - SCOPE: `commands/issue/create.md` and `commands/issue/create-interview.md`
#     are the 2 actual files containing the 4-arg bash literal symmetry. Each file
#     hosts 2 occurrences (Step 0 + Step 1 in create.md; Pre-flight + Return Output
#     re-patch in create-interview.md), totaling the 4 occurrences described in
#     the canonical anchor.
#   - OUT OF SCOPE — `stop-guard.sh`: file does not exist as of Issue #771 work
#     (verified 2026-05-03). The DRIFT-CHECK ANCHOR references it as a future site.
#     When the file is added, extend `SITES` below to include it.
#   - OUT OF SCOPE — `phase-transition-whitelist.sh`: this is a sourced library
#     that does NOT accept `--phase` / `--active` / `--next` / `--preserve-error-count`
#     as CLI arguments (it stores phase names in associative arrays). Including it
#     in this CLI-arg symmetry test would produce false negatives. A separate
#     test for phase-name registration (e.g., `create_post_interview` is whitelisted)
#     is a different concern handled elsewhere if needed.
#
# Intentional asymmetries (NOT covered by this test, by design):
#   The 4-site contract has two intentional, runtime-significant asymmetries that
#   this test deliberately does NOT enforce. They live in the orchestrator
#   (`create.md`) / sub-skill (`create-interview.md`) literals themselves and any
#   change must preserve them:
#
#   (a) `--if-exists` flag asymmetry:
#         - PRESENT in: orchestrator-side patches (create.md Step 0 + Step 1) and
#           caller HTML inline literals in create-interview.md Return Output.
#           These run AFTER Pre-flight has guaranteed file existence, so
#           `--if-exists` is a no-op safety net.
#         - ABSENT in: functional bash blocks inside create-interview.md
#           (Pre-flight + Return Output re-patch). These must branch on
#           `[ -f "$state_file" ]` to handle the file-absent case via `create`
#           mode, which `--if-exists` (a patch-mode-only silent-skip flag)
#           cannot express.
#
#   (b) path expression asymmetry:
#         - `{plugin_root}/hooks/flow-state-update.sh` in functional code
#           (Claude Code plugin loader expands `{plugin_root}` before LLM sees it).
#         - `bash plugins/rite/hooks/flow-state-update.sh ...` (relative path,
#           cwd=repo_root) in caller HTML inline literals — embedding
#           `{plugin_root}` inside an HTML comment would cause the LLM to pass
#           the literal placeholder to the shell, breaking execution.
#
#   The 4-arg symmetry test below is the canonical drift detector for the
#   symmetric part of the contract. The asymmetric part above is preserved by
#   matching the literals already present in create.md / create-interview.md when
#   editing — do NOT "normalize" `--if-exists` or path expressions across sites.
#
# Test cases:
#   For each (site, arg) pair in SITES × REQUIRED_ARGS, assert that grep -cE
#   reports >= 1. Coarse drift detector (won't catch removal from one occurrence
#   if other occurrences in the same file remain) but matches the granularity
#   anticipated by Issue #771 pseudo code.
#
# When this test fails:
#   The 4-site bash literal symmetry has drifted. Locate the failing (file, arg)
#   pair, inspect the DRIFT-CHECK ANCHOR comments in create.md / create-interview.md
#   for guidance, and restore the missing argument. Do NOT relax the test to make
#   it pass — symmetry restoration is the correct fix.
