# worktree-live-cwd.sh — OS-ground-truth liveness probe for a worktree directory.
#
# Answers a single question: "is any live process standing in this directory
# (cwd at it or nested under it)?" — independent of rite's own flow-state
# bookkeeping.
#
# Why this exists (Issue #1544, regression of #1524):
#   When a session enters a session worktree via `EnterWorktree`, the harness
#   records that worktree as the session's cwd and restores it on `/clear`. If the
#   worktree is removed (cross-session lazy reap in pr-cycle-cleanup.sh Step 5, or
#   a cleanup from a different cwd in cleanup.md Step 4-W) while the owning
#   session's harness cwd still points there, `/clear` fails with
#   `Error: Path "..." does not exist`. #1524's guards key off flow-state
#   (`active` flag + `worktree` field); those can DRIFT from where harness cwds
#   actually are (active=false but still standing in it, empty/nulled `worktree`
#   field, stale session-id). This probe does not depend on that bookkeeping — it
#   reads the OS's own record of each process's cwd, so "don't delete a tree
#   someone is standing in" holds even when flow-state is wrong.
#
# Usage:
#   worktree-live-cwd.sh <dir>
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = a live process has cwd == <dir> or nested under it  → DO NOT remove
#   1 = no live process is standing in <dir>                → safe (per other gates)
#   2 = cannot determine (no /proc and no lsof)             → caller decides
#
# Portability: avoids GNU `realpath` (canonicalizes via `cd && pwd -P`) to keep
# the macOS bash 3.2 floor shared with pr-cycle-cleanup.sh. `/proc` is the
# primary source (Linux); `lsof` is the fallback (BSD/macOS). Same-user processes
# are readable, and Claude Code sessions run as the same user.
