# Changelog

All notable changes to Rite Workflow will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

<!--
Phase number policy: Entries describe changes at the feature-name level, not
internal `Phase X.Y.Z` implementation identifiers. Phase numbers inside
`review.md` / `fix.md` / `pr/open.md` may be renumbered between releases, so
CHANGELOG entries must remain stable across such refactors. When a change
genuinely needs locational precision, prefer referencing the file name
(e.g. `review.md`) over internal phase numbers. See Keep a Changelog 1.1.0
"Guiding Principles" for the rationale and conventions.

History-dependent phrasing policy: Entries describe each change at the feature
level. A Fixed/Changed/Removed entry may state the prior behavior it corrects —
that is the change log's purpose — but it must name the specific key, feature,
or behavior involved (e.g. `multi_session.enabled`, `max_review_fix_loops`)
rather than a vague implicit reference ("the previous behavior", "the old way")
whose baseline a new reader cannot resolve. Each version section is itself the
comparison anchor, so avoid cross-version "used to / previously" framing that is
not tied to a named key or feature. Breaking-change notices and migration guides
that aid upgraders are kept verbatim.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.4] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- **`setup` proactively detects and warns about two sandbox-related environment constraints at `/rite:setup` time, instead of only surfacing them after a failure** — (1) Phase 4.8 (requires `multi_session` enabled): a session worktree's cwd is rejected when writing state (`flow-state.sh` / `issue-claim.sh` etc.) into the main checkout after `EnterWorktree`; (2) Phase 4.9 (independent of `multi_session`): a sandboxed session with an SSH host alias remote (e.g. `git@github.com-work:owner/repo.git`) hits a Bad Gateway failure on `git push`/`fetch`. Sandbox-enabled detection can't be done from bash, so both phases use the same approach (Claude's own execution-context judgment). (#1907, #1925, #1938)

### Changed

- **BREAKING: the reviewer read-only guarantee is re-layered — `pre-tool-bash-guard.sh` no longer machine-blocks working-tree git verbs, keeping only the `.git`-write machine gate** — the static verb denylist (sub-blocks (A)–(G): `checkout`/`reset`/`add`/`commit`/`branch`/`stash`/`fetch` flags/`worktree` sub-actions and 20+ more, plus that denylist's whole-command git global-flag normalization and the worktree-add argument scan) is removed from the PreToolUse hook (cut by roughly a third, 922 → under 600 lines) — the surviving `.git`-write gate (sub-block (N) below) retains a global-flag normalization scoped to just its four subcommands, ending the recurring bypass-patch churn (11 hardening commits in 3 months) and structurally eliminating its false-positive class. Working-tree mutations are visible and recoverable via `git status`, so their guarantee is now Layer 1 (the READ-ONLY contract in `_reviewer-base.md`, unchanged) + Layer 3 (`post-review-state-verify.sh` branch/stash/branch-list/worktree drift detection after each review — detection logic unchanged; its header and drift-WARNING guidance messages were updated for the new layering). The machine gate keeps only what those layers cannot cover — all still fail-closed: writes into a `.git` directory via a redirect or file-mutating verb (invisible to `git status`, irreversible, RCE-grade — sub-block (H)); native `.git`-writing git subcommands that no redirect/file-verb detection can see — `git config` write forms (`core.hooksPath` / `core.fsmonitor` / `alias.*=!cmd` are the RCE vector), mutating `git remote`, `git update-ref`, `git symbolic-ref` — as a fixed 4-subcommand closed set (sub-block (N); read forms like `git config --list/--get` stay allowed); the shell-wrapper block (`eval`/`sh -c`/… would trivially hide a `.git` write); and the oversized-command length guard (timeout→fail-open bypass prevention). Deny pattern names change accordingly: `reviewer-state-mutating-git` no longer exists; the surviving gates emit `reviewer-gitdir-write` (both (H) and (N)) / `reviewer-shell-wrapper` / `reviewer-oversized-command`. If a regression appears, individual verbs can be re-added without reviving the whole harness. (#1879)
- **BREAKING: the 5 overlapping specialist reviewers (`api` / `frontend` / `performance` / `database` / `type-design`) are consolidated into a single `application-reviewer`** — their checklists mutually overlapped (N+1 was covered by both performance and database, XSS by both security and frontend, etc.), and each spawned reviewer injects the shared `_reviewer-base.md` (~430 lines) again, so a mixed PR that selected all 5 paid `base×5` injection for largely redundant perspectives. The consolidated `application` reviewer holds the combined purpose (application-code correctness, performance, data operations, interface design) as a persona + first-suspect lenses and delegates detailed checkpoint selection to model judgment; it inherits the Database-migration Hypothetical Exception (migration findings only, `severity-levels.md` unchanged). Reviewer registry shrinks from 13 to 9 types. Legacy type names appearing as input (rite-config values, stored review-result JSON, manual input) are substituted with `application` after a WARNING — never silently skipped.

  **Migration table (legacy reviewer type → new type):**

  | Legacy reviewer type | New type |
  |----------------------|----------|
  | `api` | `application` |
  | `frontend` | `application` |
  | `performance` | `application` |
  | `database` | `application` |
  | `type-design` | `application` |

### Fixed

- **Sandbox-enabled environments (bubblewrap-based) now work around the permanent `.git/config` write rejection** — worktree creation's upstream-tracking setup (`branch.autoSetupMerge`) and `git push -u`'s upstream setup both hit this rejection, leaving the open→implement→pr-create flow stalled mid-way (branch created, not yet pushed). Worktree creation now adds `--no-track`, `git push -u` / bare `git push` are unified to `git push origin {branch}` (upstream tracking is no longer needed since flow-state always retains the branch name), and `gh pr create` gets an explicit `--head` to resolve the correct head without an upstream. (#1898)
- **`gh` shorthand commands (`gh repo view` etc.) failed to resolve the repo when `origin` is an SSH host alias remote** (e.g. `git@github.com-work:owner/repo.git`) — `gh`'s host allowlist can't recognize aliases. A new `resolve_owner_repo()` (`hooks/scripts/lib/git-remote.sh`) parses owner/repo directly from the `git remote` URL instead of depending on `gh repo view`, and `-R`/`--repo` is now propagated explicitly across internal scripts, SKILL.md procedure snippets, and recovery-hint commands wherever they depend on repo context. (#1913, #1917, #1919, #1921)
- **`mktemp`'s hardcoded `/tmp`-root templates are eliminated project-wide for sandbox environments**, where writes are confined to `$TMPDIR` and `/tmp` itself is read-only — both production code and the test harness now use the `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/rite-*` form, and a new `tmp-hardcode-check.sh` lint guard (check table #16) prevents regressions. (#1902, #1909, #1910)
- **Sandbox write-blocking mounts (character-device `/dev/null` bind mounts) were misdetected as untracked (`??`) by `git status`**, causing `cleanup`/`recover`/`issue-update`/`pr-create`'s dirty checks to false-positive with no real changes present — a new shared filter (`lib/git-status-filtered.sh`) excludes only untracked character-device entries, and the 4 affected skills' dirty checks now go through it. (#1936, #1937)
- **`issue-implement` replaces `git add .` with explicit path staging (`git add {changed_files}`)** — sandboxed sessions mask read-denied home dotfiles (`~/.ssh`, `.bashrc`, `.gitconfig`, etc.) as untracked character devices, and `git add .` hard-failed (exit 1) trying to pick them up as "not a regular file," stalling the implementation-phase commit. (#1926)

### Known Limitations

- `git push`/`fetch` over an SSH host alias (e.g. `git@github.com-work:...`) has no permanent fix on Linux/WSL2 with sandbox enabled — `sandbox.excludedCommands` cannot bypass the network sandbox (upstream: not planned). The supported workaround is re-running the specific blocked command with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`; `/rite:setup` now warns about this proactively.
- With `multi_session` and sandbox both enabled, writes from a session worktree's cwd into the main checkout (state files written by `flow-state.sh` / `issue-claim.sh` etc.) can be rejected. The main checkout root's absolute path must be added to the sandbox write allowlist manually; `/rite:setup` now guides this proactively.
- Reviewer subagents spawned via Task cannot be passed a sandbox-bypass flag equivalent to `dangerouslyDisableSandbox`.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- **`/rite:batch-run`'s `run-queue.json` is now session-scoped to stop concurrent batch-runs from clobbering each other** — the queue file is renamed `run-queue-{session_id}.json` (session_id derived from `flow-state.sh path`, reusing the canonical `_resolve_session_id`), so two sessions running `/rite:batch-run` in parallel under `multi_session` worktrees each hold an independent queue instead of overwriting/deleting a shared repo-global `run-queue.json` (which caused mis-reported completion and unrecoverable resume). All readers/writers follow suit — `batch-run/SKILL.md` steps 0-8 (fail-loud if session_id is unresolvable rather than falling back to the global name), `iterate/SKILL.md` step 6's circuit-breaker batch detection, and `recover/SKILL.md` Phase 5.5 (both read-only sites degrade safely to interactive / no-continuation on an unresolvable session_id). Batch resume is now strictly same-session; single-session behavior (compact-crossing persistence, arg-less resume, Phase 5.5 detection) is unchanged since session_id is stable across compaction and turns.
- **Reviewer subagents can no longer mutate the parent working tree or `.git` via Edit/Write** — a new `pre-tool-edit-guard.sh` PreToolUse hook (matcher `Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit`) denies a reviewer subagent's Edit/Write when the target is inside the repo but outside an isolation worktree. Isolation is judged by the target's owning git worktree root (resolved via dirname walk-up + `git -C`) rather than a path substring match, so `..`-reentry and token-in-filename bypasses no longer slip through while worktree-only mutation testing (`rite-review-mutation-*` / `rite-revert-test-*`) is not misdetected. Writes into the parent `.git` directory (e.g. `.git/hooks/pre-commit`, `.git/config`) are denied too, since those enable arbitrary code execution in the non-sandboxed main session. `post-review-state-verify.sh` gains a 4th worktree-hash axis (advisory), and `_reviewer-base.md` documents the isolation-worktree-only constraint for Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit. (#1860, #1863)
- **Reviewer subagents can no longer reach the parent `.git` via Bash or symlink** — closing the residual gap left by the Edit/Write guard (#1863). `pre-tool-bash-guard.sh` gains sub-block (H) that denies `.git`-directory writes through redirection (`> .git/…`) and positional file-writing verbs (`tee`/`cp`/`mv`/`ln`/`install`/`rsync`/`truncate`/`dd of=`/`sponge`/`patch`), while `.git` reads (`cat`/`ls`/`grep`, `dd if=`) and isolation-worktree creation are not misdetected. The `.git`-path check runs over a pre-normalization snapshot with full quote- and backslash-dequoting (mirroring POSIX quote-removal) on both the path and verb tokens to close static-obfuscation bypasses, the tokenizer is `set -f`/`set +f` noglob-wrapped to prevent hook-CWD glob pollution and timeout→fail-open, and the verb allowlist is declared non-exhaustive (COMMON-SET). `pre-tool-edit-guard.sh` also physically resolves a symlinked final path component before the isolation check. (#1864, #1865)
- **`pre-tool-bash-guard.sh`'s `git worktree add` argument scan is now glob-safe** — the `for tok in $WT_ARGS` loop is wrapped in a `set -f`/`set +f` noglob scope (matching the (H) tokenizer), closing two exposures: an over-DENY where a flag-named file (`-b` etc.) in the hook CWD let `*` expand and misclassify a valid `git worktree add <path> <ref>` as the new-branch form, and a timeout→fail-open where a large-directory glob made the loop iterate unbounded until the PreToolUse hook timed out and bypassed the worktree-add branch-leak check. (#1866, #1867)
- **`/rite:batch-run` no longer stalls on `open`'s plan approval or `pr-review`'s configuration prompt** — reconciling batch-run's declared fully-autonomous (no-confirmation) contract with actual behavior. `open` step 3.4 now auto-approves the implementation plan when a batch run is active (run-queue detection, same shape as `iterate` step 6), while standalone runs still use `AskUserQuestion`; `pr-review` step 3.3 skips the reviewer-configuration `AskUserQuestion` on the E2E (iterate-driven) path via a flow-state phase-whitelist check (same shape as `ready` Phase 2.1), keeping the launched/omitted-reviewer summary lines on both paths. Both fall back to interactive/standalone on helper failure. (#1861, #1868)

## [0.8.2] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- **`setup` detects and warns on a version mismatch between `plugin-path-resolution.md`'s two resolution methods** — step 4.5.0's marketplace branch now cross-checks the direct key lookup against the canonical one-liner resolution and displays both paths, the mismatch, and remediation guidance when they disagree (non-blocking; matching resolution is unaffected). Adding a third resolution method is now explicitly disallowed in `plugin-path-resolution.md`. (#1833, #1841)

### Fixed

- **`installPath` semantics are now consistent across all consumers** — real-environment verification against `rite@rite-marketplace` v0.8.1 confirmed `installPath` points at the plugin root itself (`hooks/`, `skills/`, `scripts/`, `references/` sit directly under it, with no `plugins/rite/` intermediate directory). `hook-preamble.sh`'s incorrect `$current_install_path/plugins/rite/hooks` reference (which had silently turned the version-redirect logic into dead code) is corrected, and `plugin-path-resolution.md` now documents the verified semantics. (#1842, #1852, #1854)
- **Work Memory (WM) sync route is repaired** — `open/SKILL.md` step 2.5's initial WM post now wires an explicit `issue-comment-wm-sync.sh init` call with a status branch table (previously prose-only, so the call was never actually made), and `work-memory-update.sh` no longer discards the accumulated `## Detail` section on every phase-transition rewrite — it extracts and preserves that section verbatim, regenerating only the `Phase:`/`Branch:` header lines. (#1830, #1838)
- **WM sync route follow-up hardening** — `work-memory-update.sh` surfaces a return-code-bearing WARNING when `detail_extra` awk extraction fails instead of silently falling back, `issue-comment-wm-sync.sh`'s init pre-check gains a regression test pinning its non-blocking-degrade contract, 10 parent-shell tempfiles are protected under one file-wide cleanup function with an EXIT/INT/TERM/HUP trap, and the WM-sync architecture diagram is updated to match. (#1844, #1849)
- **Review-result and PR-state storage is unified onto `state-path-resolve.sh`** — `review-result-save.sh`'s `REVIEW_RESULTS_DIR` default and `review-source-resolve.sh`'s local-JSON read priority now resolve through the same state-root anchor `wiki-ingest-trigger.sh` already used, fixing a `multi_session` mismatch where a session worktree wrote review results and PR-state (accepted-fingerprints, fix-cycle-state) cwd-relative inside the worktree while the main checkout read/deleted from a different path (an explicit `--results-dir`/`--repo-root` still takes priority; resolution failure falls back to cwd-relative with a WARNING). (#1831, #1839)
- **Regression tests pin the 4 observation points changed by the state-path-resolve unification** — a new `state-root-observers.test.sh` (11 assertions) covers `review-schema-version-check.sh --all` drift detection from a worktree cwd, `review-skip-notification.sh`'s state-root path display, and `distributed-fix-drift-check.sh` Pattern 6's `--repo-root` non-propagation contract, closing a gap where these behaviors were verified only by manual sandbox testing. (#1845, #1850)
- **`open`/`cleanup`'s GitHub Projects Status update is inlined to stop silent skips** — both `open/SKILL.md` step 2.4(A) (Status → In Progress) and `cleanup/SKILL.md` step 8 (Status → Done) previously described delegation to `projects-status-update.sh` in prose only, with no actual bash call in the skill body; inside long autonomous chains like `/rite:batch-run` this reference-only step was skipped, leaving Status stuck at Todo/In Progress instead of reaching its final state. (#1846, #1847)
- **`projects-status-update.sh` call sites no longer discard failure detail** — the `status_json=$(bash ...) || status_json=""` pattern used in `ready/SKILL.md`, `issue-close/SKILL.md`, and `cleanup/references/archive-procedures.md` overwrote the script's already-emitted failure JSON (including `.warnings[]`) with an empty string whenever the script exited non-zero; the fallback is unnecessary since command substitution captures stdout regardless of exit status, and is removed from the 4 remaining sites. (#1848, #1851)
- **`multi_session` gains a dirty-main-checkout guard in `open`/`cleanup`** — `open` step 2.2-W detects uncommitted changes in the main checkout before creating a session worktree and asks (via `AskUserQuestion`) whether to carry them into the worktree, proceed anyway, or abort, only when they overlap the Issue's target files; `cleanup` step 4 verifies merge success after 3 failed `git merge --ff-only` retries and offers a diff-confirmed discard or a stash-and-terminate path instead of silently discarding uncommitted work or leaving conflicting state. (#1832, #1840)
- **`pr-review` step 4.3.1 requires an explicit `run_in_background: false` on every reviewer Task spawn** — the prior prohibition ("do NOT use `true`") left the parameter's default unstated, and the harness's default of background execution meant omitting the parameter silently spawned reviewers in the background; this is now a MUST with rationale documented. (#1834, #1843)
- **`issue-create` pre-creates labels idempotently and surfaces helper failures** — label creation no longer fails when a label already exists, and helper failures are surfaced as a result instead of being swallowed. (#1829, #1837)
- **`lint`'s `gitignore-health-check` false positives are fixed** — the check now performs an effective-ignore determination instead of a naive pattern match, and unreachable entries introduced by `setup` are excluded from the scan. (#1836)
- **`setup` re-runs `gh project link` idempotently after Project creation** — fixes a first-Issue-create Projects registration failure that occurred when the newly created Project wasn't yet linked to the repository. (#1835)

## [0.8.1] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- **`recover` now detects and resumes an interrupted `/rite:batch-run` queue** — a new Phase 5.5 in `recover/SKILL.md` autonomously judges whether an interruption occurred mid-active-batch (via `run-queue.json`'s `active` flag, cursor match, and a 2-hour freshness check reusing `session-ownership.sh`'s `parse_iso8601_to_epoch`) and, if so, continues processing the remaining queue by following `batch-run/SKILL.md`'s existing step 3-8 branch table rather than duplicating it; stale `run-queue.json` leftovers no longer trigger a false continuation. `run-queue.json` gains an `updated_at` timestamp field, updated on every cursor advance / active-flag write. (#1820, #1821)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- **Four skills are renamed to resolve base-name collisions with Claude Code's built-in slash commands** — `run` → `batch-run`, `review` → `pr-review`, `init` → `setup`, and `resume` → `recover`. **Breaking change — invoke skills by their new names:** `/rite:run` → `/rite:batch-run`, `/rite:review` → `/rite:pr-review`, `/rite:init` → `/rite:setup`, `/rite:resume` → `/rite:recover`. All in-repo references, cross-links, and sentinel-contract identifiers are updated accordingly; these are pure renames with no behavior change. (#1788, #1790, #1793, #1794, #1795, #1796, #1800, #1803, #1804)
- **The reviewer registry's three-way sync (`agents/*-reviewer.md` ⇔ the `pr-review/SKILL.md` Available Reviewers table ⇔ its Reviewer Type Identifiers table) is now verified by a single machine check** instead of only the tech-writer-row equality check, catching agent-only additions, one-sided table updates, and slug mismatches that previously passed silently. (#1743)
- **Per-call hooks gain an early-exit fast path and consolidated `jq` calls for non-rite projects**, reducing the per-Bash/Edit-call subprocess cost outside rite projects while leaving rite-project inputs, outputs, and side effects unchanged. (#1737)
- **`pr-review/SKILL.md` and `fix/SKILL.md` are put on a context diet** — design rationale, historical background, and external-spec narration move out of the skill body into `references/`, shrinking `fix/SKILL.md` by 8.2% (4,040 → 3,709 lines) and `pr-review/SKILL.md` by 13.1% (4,040 → 3,510 lines). The "SKILL.md < 500 lines" principle is revised to match this two-tier reality (entry skills stay under 500 lines; execution-procedure skills are capped at 4,000). (#1774)

### Added

- **`/rite:unknowns` skill** — a new explicitly-invoked pre-implementation exploration session (blind-spot pass, multi-approach brainstorming, throwaway HTML prototypes, requirements interview) that ends by emitting an exploration summary for downstream skills like `issue-create`. Wired to `wiki-query-inject.sh` so accumulated Wiki lessons feed the blind-spot pass. (#1805)
- **`issue-create` recognizes a `/rite:unknowns` exploration summary and lightens Assumption Surfacing accordingly** — questions and blind spots already resolved by the summary skip re-asking, and unresolved questions flow directly into the existing three-way classification. (#1806)
- **`issue-create` Step 4.0 gains a "blind spot pass" (unknown unknowns) sub-step** for Complexity M+ issues, feeding discoveries into the existing derive/ask/defer classification without new code paths. (#1755)
- **`open` Step 3.3's implementation-plan template adopts a volatile-first ordering rule** — items likely to change under user judgment (data model changes, type/interface definitions, user-visible behavior/UX) are presented before mechanical refactors and boilerplate, focusing plan-approval review on substantive decisions. (#1752)
- **`pr-review` Step 7 is redesigned from "automatic Issue creation" to "out-of-scope finding triage"** — the AskUserQuestion recommendation moves from agent discretion to a rule-table machine decision, gains a "record to Decision Log" option, and approved records are appended to the source Issue's Section 9 Decision Log (or work memory as fallback). (#1802)
- **`pr-review` gains a `max_reviewers` cap and a pre-spawn cost-estimate summary** — reviewer selection now caps the spawned reviewer count after the existing min-reviewer/mandatory-Security guards, and always surfaces which reviewers were dropped and why instead of silently capping. Default `max_reviewers: 6` preserves prior selection for matches within the cap. (#1729)
- **`pr-create` PR bodies now summarize the Decision Log and plan-deviation log** — Phase 3.2.2 reads the Issue's Section 9 Decision Log and work memory's plan-deviation log, surfacing implementation-time judgment calls that a diff alone can't show; the section is omitted when both are empty. (#1756)
- **`iterate`'s review⇄fix loop gains a circuit breaker** — `safety.max_review_cycles` (default 5) bounds non-convergent review/fix cycling; on `batch-run`, a maxed-out PR is recorded as failed and the cursor advances instead of stalling the whole batch. (#1728)
- **`recover` detects merge-conflict and interrupted-rebase state** — unmerged markers, `MERGE_HEAD`, and `rebase-merge`/`rebase-apply` (resolved worktree-safely via `git rev-parse --git-path`) are surfaced ahead of phase inference, so conflict resolution isn't skipped in favor of a generic "implementation in progress" recovery. (#1734)
- **`batch-run` shows a pre-run summary before starting** — issue count, run mode, a rough time estimate, and interrupt/resume guidance are shown once right after the queue is finalized, plus an "N/M done" progress line per completed Issue. (#1733)
- **`setup` now writes a `safety` section into `rite-config.yml`** — previously commented out below the `--- Advanced ---` marker, `safety` (`max_implementation_rounds`, `max_review_cycles`, etc.) is promoted to the active block alongside `wiki`/`multi_session`/`tdd`, so a fresh config surfaces these safety limits instead of hiding them. (#1732)
- **The sentinel contract (~29 `[skill:action]` strings) is now Single-Source-of-Truth documented and CI-verified** — `sentinel-contract.md` centralizes the emitter/consumer table, `sentinel-contract-check.sh` verifies it bidirectionally, and the check runs as `lint` Phase 3.20 and in a dedicated GitHub Actions workflow on every push/PR. (#1771)

### Fixed

- **`fix.md` Step 5.1's sentinel-based continuation check now correctly handles an `accept` decision** — the prior logic keyed off a nonexistent "separate Issue count" left over from a policy removed in commit `0dee5b22`; it now checks the `ACCEPT_FINGERPRINT_PERSISTED` marker that Step 2.1.A already emits, so an accept decision doesn't fall through to an unconditional "normal completion" without confirming the suppression actually took effect on the next review. (#1813)
- **`flow-state.sh`'s `cmd_set` no longer silently drops `wm_comment_id`** — the field written directly by `issue-comment-wm-sync.sh`'s `cache_comment_id()` was missing from the merge-preserve whitelist used when `cmd_set` rebuilds the JSON, so it vanished on the next unrelated phase-transition `set`. (#1812)
- **`issue-comment-wm-sync.sh` and `cleanup-work-memory.sh` are schema_v2/v3 multi-state aware** — both resolved `FLOW_STATE` by writing directly to the legacy shared file (`.rite-flow-state`) instead of going through the canonical per-session resolver (`.rite/sessions/{sid}.flow-state`), causing `wm_comment_id` cache misses (extra `gh api` scans) and stale `active:true`/`phase:cleanup` sessions to linger past `/rite:cleanup`, confusing `/rite:recover` and the Stop hook. Both now resolve via `flow-state.sh path` and fall back to the legacy file (with a warning) only on resolver failure. (#1808, #1809)
- **`pre-tool-bash-guard`'s Pattern 4 (blocking reviewer-subagent state-mutating git commands) is fail-closed and has a timeout** — Pattern 4 shared a fail-open `ERR` trap with convenience Patterns 1–3, so a parser crash on unexpected input converged on `exit 0` (allow), letting a single crash bypass the reviewer read-only guard; Pattern 4 now fails closed independently, and `PreToolUse:Bash` gains the timeout every other hook already had. (#1736)
- **`test-distributed-fix-drift-check.sh` no longer fails on shallow clones** — a `git fetch --depth=1 origin <full-sha>` fallback resolves the otherwise-unreachable baseline commit (now referenced by full SHA), and remaining-unreachable cases produce an explicit skip message instead of a silent pass or a false CI failure. (#1741)
- **Locking is hardened against three known gaps** — `issue-claim.sh`'s stale-steal now compare-and-swaps the holder under the lock (closing a TOCTOU window where two sessions could both classify and steal the same stale claim), PID-reuse is detected instead of trusted on sight, and eval-time validation is made symmetric with sibling scripts. (#1742)
- **`reviewer-registry-drift-check.sh` improves diagnostic precision and closes a slug-regex blind spot** — per-source error messages stop swallowing `find` stderr (e.g. `EACCES`) in the `agents/` path, and the identifier regex now accepts digits in slugs (e.g. `web3-reviewer.md`), which previously fell out of all three tracked sets and passed silently. (#1762)
- **A `@tsv` + `IFS` field-shift hazard is fixed across the remaining per-call hooks** — following the `bang-backtick-edit-hook.sh` fix in #1737, `session-start.sh`'s `_reset_active_state()` (and other affected sites) switch to a unit-separator (`\x1f`) join/read so an empty intermediate TSV field no longer left-shifts subsequent fields. (#1767)

### Removed

- **Two config keys that had zero effect on runtime behavior are removed**: `fix.fail_fast_response` (never read by any consumer; the template itself admitted flipping it did nothing) and `review.scope_assignment.enabled` (consumers read `auto_demote_low` directly and never checked `enabled`, so the documented opt-out never worked). `auto_demote_low` itself remains fully wired and is unaffected. (#1727)

## [0.7.2] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- `disable-model-invocation: true` is removed from 14 user-invocable skills (`issue-create`, `issue-update`, `issue-close`, `issue-edit`, `wiki-init`, `wiki-query`, `learn`, `skill-suggest`, `template-reset`, `getting-started`, `workflow`, `investigate`, `resume`, `run`) — the Claude Code CLI routes an explicitly typed slash command and the model's own Skill-tool invocation through the same path, so when native slash-command dispatch is not recognized (e.g. with an attached image), the model's Skill-tool fallback was blocked by this flag, causing the user's own direct invocation to fail (see [anthropics/claude-code#43660](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/43660)). `workflow` and `investigate` descriptions gain the non-auto-activate wording that the flag used to carry. (#1694)

### Changed

- `reviewers/SKILL.md` frontmatter gains `user-invocable: false`, and the `docs/SPEC.md` frontmatter policy table's third category is corrected to match: `user-invocable: false` guarantees the absence of a `/rite:<name>` command, while `disable-model-invocation` is reserved for suppressing auto-activation on skills with a broad description. (#1696)

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- The intro video HyperFrames sources are now tracked in-repo under
  `media/intro-video/` (Japanese) and `media/intro-video-en/` (English), so
  video updates complete inside this repository instead of an external
  out-of-tree directory; each project carries a `PROVENANCE.md` documenting
  build steps and BGM source/license. (#1688)

### Changed

- The intro video content and README video links are updated to the v0.7.0
  spec: command names use the v0.7 flat hyphenated form (`open`, `iterate`,
  `ready`, `merge`, `cleanup`, `issue-create`), `scene-goal` now demos
  `/rite:run --merge` self-driving, a new `scene-docheavy` scene covers
  Doc-Heavy PR Mode, and the README video duration note becomes ~115 seconds. (#1688)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-30

### Changed

- **Workflow entry points migrated from `commands/` to native Claude Code skills (`skills/`)** — each former `commands/<group>/<name>.md` is now a `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` that Claude Code auto-detects, and orchestrator skills (`open`, `iterate`, `run`, …) invoke sub-skills (`review`, `fix`, `pr-create`, `issue-implement`, …) through the Skill tool. **Breaking change — the invocation namespace is flattened:** the grouped colon form is gone; invoke skills by their flat names instead. Migration: `/rite:pr:open` → `/rite:open`, `/rite:pr:review` → `/rite:review`, `/rite:pr:create` → `/rite:pr-create`, `/rite:issue:create` → `/rite:issue-create`, `/rite:wiki:ingest` → `/rite:wiki-ingest`, and likewise for the remaining `pr:` / `issue:` / `wiki:` commands. (#1682)
- **The SessionStart hook's CRITICAL banner is downgraded to a `/rite:resume` pointer** — with the preflight mechanism removed, post-compact recovery is consolidated onto `/rite:resume` instead of an unconditional CRITICAL session-start block. (#1682)

### Removed

- **The `commands/` directory is removed in full (42 files)** along with the old grouped command naming; `skills/` is now the single source for both entry points and execution procedures, and the `lint` scanners were repointed from `commands/` to `skills/`. (#1682)
- **The `preflight-check.sh` mechanism is removed** — its responsibilities are folded into `/rite:resume`, and the architecture diagram and README no longer reference Preflight Check. (#1682)

## [0.6.12] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- **Flow entry paths now detect and rebuild a missing session worktree for an existing work branch under `multi_session.enabled: true`** — when a work branch existed locally but its session worktree (`.rite/worktrees/issue-{N}`) was absent, `/rite:resume`, `/rite:pr:review`, `/rite:pr:iterate`, and `/rite:pr:fix` treated the branch as nonexistent and silently fell back to `develop`, leaving PR changes unreadable from the work tree (degraded operation). A new `ensure_session_worktree` helper in `lib/worktree-git.sh` detects the "branch exists ∧ session worktree absent" case and rebuilds the worktree (local: `git worktree add`; remote: fetch + `--track`). (#1676, #1677)

## [0.6.11] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed

- **`/rite:pr:cleanup` no longer self-blocks worktree and branch deletion for the Issue it is cleaning up** — the cleanup live-cwd guard (`worktree-live-cwd.sh`) could not distinguish the cleanup session's own working directory from another session's, so it detected itself as "live" and deferred deletion. A new `worktree-foreign-cwd.sh` probe excludes the self process tree (`--self-root`) so deletion is deferred only when another live session is actually present. Branches that are genuinely deferred — previously left permanently with no recovery path — are now recorded in the reap manifest and reclaimed by the next session, while unmerged/dirty branches stay protected. (#1670, #1671)

## [0.6.10] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **The `/rite:wiki:ingest` raw-source write path now matches the commit scan path in multi-session worktree mode** — under `multi_session.enabled: true`, `wiki-ingest-trigger.sh` wrote raw sources to a `$PWD`-relative `.rite/wiki/raw/` (the session worktree) while `wiki-ingest-commit.sh` scanned the main checkout's `.rite/wiki/raw/`, so raw sources collected from a session worktree were silently dropped instead of committed to the wiki branch. Both sites now resolve the same scan root. (#1664, #1665)
- **Raw-source accumulation now self-heals from a corrupt/orphaned `.rite/wiki-worktree`** — a stale gitdir pointer (e.g. after a repository move) left an orphaned `.rite/wiki-worktree` that passed the `[ -d ]` fast-path but failed `git rev-parse`, silently halting raw-source accumulation; the path now recovers instead of stopping silently. (#1662, #1663)
- **Box-drawing frames no longer misalign their right border when the header contains full-width characters** — right-border padding was counted by code points, so full-width (East Asian Width `W`/`F`) characters widened the inner width; padding now treats full-width characters as 2 columns to match the top border's `─` count, with the rule captured in `references/box-display-width.md`. (#1660, #1661)

## [0.6.9] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **The `.claude/scheduled_tasks.lock` file is now gitignored and untracked** — this session-specific lock file, which the Claude Code harness overwrites every session, kept the working tree permanently dirty and aborted `git pull` under `pull.rebase=true`. It is now ignored per-file (not via a blanket `.claude/` ignore, since `.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md` is intentionally committed). (#1654, #1655)

## [0.6.8] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- **The release skill's Phase 1 latest-tag detection is now reachability-independent and limited to the `vX.Y.Z` release-tag format** — detection uses `git tag --sort=-v:refname` filtered by `grep -E '^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$'` (preceded by `git fetch --tags --force`) instead of `git describe --tags --abbrev=0`, so the latest release tag is found correctly even when it sits on a `main` merge commit unreachable from `develop`, and non-release tags are excluded from the version sort. (#1643, #1647)
- **The release skill's Phase 1 tag-sync no longer fails silently** — a failed `git fetch --tags --force` now emits a log line and continues with local tags instead of swallowing the error. (#1648)

### Docs

- **Documented that the `git tag … | head -1` SIGPIPE is benign in the release skill** — the trailing `head -1` can close the pipe early, but `latest_tag` is guarded by a `[ -n "$latest_tag" ]` check so the pipeline exit status is never consulted; a note clarifies this and flags the `set -o pipefail` caveat for the future. (#1649)

## [0.6.7] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- **Parent-Issue detection in `cleanup.md` no longer misidentifies the closing Issue itself or an unrelated Issue as the parent** — the Tasklist fallback now fetches multiple candidates, excludes self-matches, and re-validates each candidate's body for an actual `- [ ] #N` / `- [x] #N` tasklist line instead of adopting the first GitHub code-search hit. (#1637)
- **Parent-Issue detection via tasklist search in `projects-integration.md` and `close.md` no longer misidentifies self or unrelated Issues as the parent** — the search retrieves multiple candidates, excludes self-matches, and validates candidate bodies before adopting a parent. (#1634)
- **`/rite:pr:open` now surfaces the parent-Issue GitHub Projects status update in `open.md`**, so starting work on a Sub-Issue transitions the parent Issue's status from Todo to In Progress instead of leaving it at Todo. (#1630)
- **Resolved the contradictory standalone parent-not-detected handling in `projects-integration.md`** — the spec now consistently emits the `[DEBUG] parent not detected` log before skipping, matching the rule that silent skips are prohibited. (#1636)
- **Unified the standalone parent-not-detected DEBUG wording to `methods tried:` across `close.md`, `projects-integration.md`, and `open.md`**, so all three sites emit verbatim-identical diagnostics. (#1635)

## [0.6.6] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- **GitHub Projects registration no longer performs owner-type detection, so Organization-owned Projects are supported** — the previous owner-type probe failed for Projects owned by an Organization; removing it lets both user-owned and organization-owned Projects register. (#1612)
- **GitHub Projects field names resolve via built-in English/Japanese aliases plus optional config overrides, supporting Japanese-named Projects** — field lookups (`Status`/`ステータス`, etc.) now succeed on Projects whose fields use Japanese names without extra configuration. (#1614)
- **PR cleanup worktree detection is anchored to the physical cwd**, eliminating leftover worktrees when a worktree was not recorded in flow state. (#1623)
- **Fixed the `cleanup.md` anchor link to point to `main-checkout`.** (#1611)

### Changed

- **Updated the graphql-helpers owner-type documentation to a `repository()`-independent path**, aligning the docs with the registration logic that no longer depends on `repository()`. (#1615)

## [0.6.5] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **`/rite:pr:cleanup` and `/rite:pr:open` base-branch updates now use `git fetch` + `git merge --ff-only` instead of `git pull --ff-only`** — under a consumer environment with `pull.rebase=true` and a dirty working tree, `git pull --ff-only` aborted early with `cannot pull with rebase: You have unstaged changes` because `git pull` enters its rebase pre-check (which requires a clean working tree) even when `--ff-only` is set. Splitting the update into `git fetch origin {base}` + `git merge --ff-only origin/{base}` bypasses the rebase path entirely, so a fast-forwardable base branch updates reliably regardless of the `pull.rebase` setting or working-tree state. Applies to the `multi_session` and legacy paths of `cleanup.md`, the branch-creation chain of `open.md` (with the `git switch -c` `&&` chain preserved), and the matching descriptions in `getting-started.md` / `docs/SPEC.md`. (#1602)

## [0.6.4] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **`/rite:pr:open` branch creation is now worktree-isolated as a hard invariant under `multi_session.enabled: true`** — branch creation re-resolves `multi_session` from `rite-config.yml` immediately before the branch is created (instead of relying on a `[CONTEXT]` marker that can be lost across resume / context compaction / mid-flow entry), so the `git switch -c` legacy path is reachable only when `multi_session.enabled: false`. After `EnterWorktree`, an invariant check verifies the repository top-level matches the worktree path and halts on mismatch instead of silently continuing on the main tree; `flow-state.sh set --require-worktree` emits a loud warning when a branch/PR phase would be recorded without a worktree. (#1596)

## [0.6.3] - 2026-06-19

### Docs

- Restructured the README into a bilingual layout: `README.md` (English, with the English intro video) and a new `README.ja.md` (Japanese, with the Japanese intro video), cross-linked by a language switcher at the top of each (#1585, #1587)

## [0.6.2] - 2026-06-19

### Docs

- Added a Demo section with an introductory video (Japanese subtitles) near the top of the README (#1580)

## [0.6.1] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **`EnterWorktree` failure under harness git misdetection now points to a restart remedy** — when `multi_session.enabled: true` (default), `/rite:pr:open` Step 2.3-W and `/rite:resume` re-entry detect the harness git repository misdetection (`.git` present and `git` CLI healthy, but the startup check reports false) and recommend restarting Claude Code from the repository root so the already-created worktree is reused (`WT_CASE=reuse`), instead of offering only the prior "abort / `git switch -c`" fallback. Documented in `getting-started.md` and `git-worktree-patterns.md`. (#1574)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- **Canon TDD cycle for the implementation phase** — when `tdd.enabled: true` (default on), `/rite:issue:implement` drives implementation through a Canon TDD loop: pick one behavior from the test list → confirm Red → minimal Green → Refactor → repeat until the list is empty. Falls back gracefully: `commands.test: null` runs in "Degraded TDD" mode (test-list discipline kept, auto-run skipped with a warning), and `tdd.enabled: false` restores the prior non-TDD flow. (#1567)
- **`tdd:` configuration section, default-on (opt-out)** — distributed `rite-config.yml` ships a `tdd:` section with `enabled: true`; `/rite:init --upgrade` back-adds it to existing projects via the same active-section mechanism as `wiki` / `multi_session`. (#1566)
- **Canon TDD documentation and test-list framing** — the Issue template Section 6 "Test Specification" is now framed as the Canon TDD test list (one T-xx row = one Red→Green→Refactor cycle), reflected across `skills/rite-workflow`, `docs/SPEC.md`, getting-started, and `pr/open.md`. (#1568)

## [0.5.5] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- **`bang-backtick-check.sh` no longer hard-blocks consumer repos** — a new `--skip-if-no-target` flag makes `--all` return a clean skip (rc=0) instead of an `rc=2` invocation error when there is no `plugins/rite/` markdown to scan (marketplace-only consumer repos), removing the forced manual gate bypass in `/rite:pr:ready` and `/rite:pr:create`. Self-host repos keep the original `rc=2` misconfiguration diagnostic. (#1551)
- **Active-but-idle session worktrees protected from lazy reap** — `pr-cycle-cleanup.sh` keeps a worktree whose issue claim holder is `active=true` even when the claim heartbeat has gone stale (idle past `CLAIM_STALE_SECONDS`), preventing the `/clear` "Path does not exist" error from recurring on resume. (#1553)
- **Read-only commands relay their real output again** — removed `context: fork` from `/rite:issue:list`, `/rite:investigate`, `/rite:workflow`, and `/rite:skill:suggest` so their output is shown inline instead of being replaced by the harness control wrapper. (#1556)
- **`orphan-reference-check.sh --all` works inside session worktrees** — the `--all` scan now walks paths relative to `REPO_ROOT`, so running from a `.rite/worktrees/issue-N` worktree no longer excludes every file and exits `2`; orphan detection is restored under the default `multi_session.enabled: true`. (#1557)

## [0.5.4] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- **OKF v0.1 minimal conformance for Wiki concept pages** — concept page frontmatter now carries `type` and `okf_version` fields, aligning Wiki pages with Open Knowledge Format v0.1.
- **OKF v0.1 sync and upstream visualizer integration guide** — documentation now covers OKF v0.1-conformant synchronization and connecting the upstream visualizer.

### Changed

- **`/rite:pr:run` defaults to draft-only** — the command runs `open → iterate` (stopping at draft) by default, and `ready → merge → cleanup` is opt-in via the `--merge` flag.
- **Wiki `index.md` reshaped to OKF bullet form with two-pass query** — `index.md` adopts an OKF bullet structure and `wiki:query` resolves in two passes.
- **Wiki `log.md` reshaped to OKF form** — `log.md` adopts an OKF structure and the `ingest:skip` state moves into raw frontmatter.

### Fixed

- **`wiki:close` heredoc write-failure guard** — `close.md` Phase 4.4.W guards against heredoc write failure, mirroring the review/fix path.
- **`/rite:pr` review/fix `$trigger_exit` defensive default** — Step 3 assigns a defensive default to `$trigger_exit`.
- **Live-process worktrees protected from `/clear` "Path does not exist"** — worktrees with a live process are protected so the `/clear` "Path does not exist" error does not recur.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- **`/rite:pr:run`** — a batch PR lifecycle command that runs `open → iterate → ready → merge → cleanup` sequentially and autonomously across multiple Issues.
- **`/rite:lint` number-reference guard** — a `number-reference-check.sh` lint (non-blocking warning) that detects Issue/PR number references (`#NNN`, `Issue #NNN`, `PR #NNN`) re-introduced into the number-free surface (`CHANGELOG.md`, `CHANGELOG.ja.md`, `lint.md`), guarding the cleaned surface against recurrence.

### Fixed

- **Parallel sessions no longer contaminate each other's flow state** — `session_id` resolution is now env-first, so concurrent sessions resolve distinct identifiers instead of clobbering a shared `flow_state`.
- **`/rite:pr:cleanup` reclaims temporary branches and worktrees name-independently** — cleanup no longer relies on branch or worktree naming to find and remove the artifacts it created.
- **In-use session worktrees are protected from reap** — lazy reap skips worktrees owned by active sessions, and `/clear` self-repairs dangling session state.
- **`drift-check` over-detection removed** — eliminated false-positive drift findings and aligned the document-missing reason emitted by the check.
- **`decompose-issues.sh` no longer crashes on an empty `labels_csv`** — Sub-Issue creation handles an empty label set instead of failing.
- **`/rite:pr:merge` success path terminates with a fixed `exit 0`** — a trailing no-op prevents the merge success path from inheriting a non-zero exit status.

### Changed

- **`wiki:ingest` write-failure handling** — the write-failure path now emits a dedicated `content_write_failed` reason instead of a generic failure reason.
- **Documentation surface made number-free and present-tense** — removed implicit history-dependent phrasing (e.g. "the previous behavior", "the old way") and Issue/PR number references across user-facing config and docs, spec and design docs, command/skill/hook/script comments, and tests, stating the rationale directly in prose. The CHANGELOG history-dependent-phrasing policy is now documented in the file header.
- **Account migration** — updated `B16B1RD` references to `asakaguchi` following the repository account transfer.

### Removed

- **README v0.4.0 Breaking Changes section** — dropped the now-historical upgrade notice from the README.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **`/rite:init --upgrade` short-circuit path no longer drops drift back-adds** — when no pending drift was detected, the `--upgrade` short-circuit path skipped the back-add step that the full path performs, so projects taking the short-circuit could miss newly added config sections and sub-keys. The short-circuit now applies the same drift back-add logic, covered by an added drift-detection test.
- **Fixed broken references to the non-existent `_resolve-flow-state-path.sh`** — updated stale script references in the hooks documentation to the actual `flow-state.sh` path.

### Changed

- **Unified flow state on the per-session model** — removed the legacy `flow_state.schema_version=1` (single-file) path from the hooks (`session-start`, `session-end`, `post-compact`, `pre-compact`, `post-tool-wm-sync`), `init.md`, and the config template, consolidating on per-session flow state. Stale `schema_version` test fixtures/labels were neutralized, `commit.contextual` was added to the SPEC Deprecated key list, and `SPEC.md` / `getting-started.md` were updated to follow the `--upgrade` drift back-add behavior change.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **`/rite:init --upgrade` now converges to the latest config defaults** — the `--upgrade` path previously dropped newly added top-level sections, new sub-keys inside existing sections, and the `multi_session` block, producing a two-tier behavior where upgraded projects drifted from what a fresh `/rite:init` produces. `--upgrade` now back-adds `multi_session` with `enabled: true` (an explicit `false` is preserved; idempotent), fills only the missing sub-keys from the template default while preserving existing sibling values, and tracks newly added top-level sections via a drift anchor. Covered by a new sub-key-merge drift-detection test (T-12), which was unified onto the shared `_test-helpers.sh` harness. `commands/getting-started.md` documents the `--upgrade` `multi_session` back-add behavior.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Session worktrees for work isolation** — `multi_session` configuration with session-scoped worktree creation via `EnterWorktree`, resume re-entry, and lazy reap on cleanup. Default ON (opt-in → default).
- **Issue claim mechanism** (`issue-claim.sh`) — fail-fast guard preventing two sessions from working the same Issue concurrently.
- **`/rite:learn`** — Socratic understanding-check command for completed Issue/PR sessions.
- **Assumption Surfacing step** in `/rite:issue:create` — surfaces implicit model assumptions and classifies them (derive / ask / defer).
- **Knowledge routing (4-channel)** added to coding principles, with comment why-over-what and rejected-alternative routing.
- **Review scope classification** — `scope` / `pre_existing` / `acknowledged` fields (review-result-schema 1.1.0), 3-way recommendation disposition, and a Phase 7 post-condition gate.
- **Wiki lint helper scripts** for the three machine-decidable categories, plus concurrent-ingest exclusion (session lock + push retry).
- **New `/rite:lint` guards** — hardcoded line-number drift, CLOSED+COMPLETED board-not-Done drift, and operational bash-block heaviness.
- Artifacts schema 1.1.0 migration script + version-drift hook.

### Changed

- `multi_session.enabled` now defaults to `true` for new projects.
- Numerous Source-of-Truth consolidations across commands, references, and templates (Type crosswalk, contract section mapping, etc.).
- Reviewer base / severity-levels gained Scope Assignment responsibility.

### Fixed

- Extensive stabilization across the review-fix loop, hooks (flow-state multi-state API, legacy `.rite-flow-state` migration, bang-backtick guard, drift-check), Issue/PR orchestration, and Wiki ingest/query (300+ fixes consolidated since v0.4.0).

> This is a large consolidation release (644 commits since v0.4.0). Entries are summarized at the feature level per the project's CHANGELOG policy.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-22

### BREAKING CHANGE

- **Cycle-count-based review-fix degradation fully abolished; replaced by 4 quality signals** — **BREAKING CHANGE**
  - **Removed configuration keys** (three keys from `rite-config.yml`; these keys were never present in `plugins/rite/templates/config/rite-config.yml`):
    - `review.loop.severity_gating_cycle_threshold`
    - `review.loop.scope_lock_cycle_threshold`
    - `safety.max_review_fix_loops`
  - **Removed logic**:
    - `plugins/rite/commands/pr/references/fix-relaxation-rules.md` convergence strategy override table (`severity_gating` / `scope_lock` / `batched` as strategies) and Loop Termination hard-limit row.
    - `plugins/rite/commands/pr/fix.md` Phase 0.4 Convergence Strategy Load (the full block loading `convergence_strategy` from `.rite-flow-state`).
    - `plugins/rite/commands/issue/start.md` Phase 5.4.6 Step 3.5 Review-Fix Loop Hard Limit Check (the `extend (+5) / retry / escalate` 3-choice dialog).
    - `plugins/rite/commands/issue/start.md` Phase 5.4.1.0 cycle-trajectory pattern analysis (Converging / Stalled / Diverging / Oscillating) and the `convergence_strategy` write to `.rite-flow-state`.
  - **New behavior**: the review-fix loop now has exactly two exit paths — (a) 0 findings → `[review:mergeable]`, or (b) any of the **four quality signals** fires → `AskUserQuestion` escalation (`本 PR 内で再試行 / 別 Issue として切り出す / PR を取り下げる / 手動レビューへエスカレーション`).
  - **Four quality signals**:
    1. Same-finding cycling — detected in `start.md` Phase 5.4.1.0 via SHA-1 fingerprints of `file + category + normalized message`. One re-occurrence escalates.
    2. Root-cause-missing fix — detected in `fix.md` Phase 3.2.1 by an LLM-semantic check of the commit body for a `root-cause(scope):` action line (new Contextual Commits action type), a `decision(scope):` line that explicitly names the root cause, or a free-form `Root cause:` / `根本原因:` paragraph. Missing → `AskUserQuestion` 3-option prompt.
    3. Cross-validation disagreement — detected in `review.md` Phase 5.2 when two reviewers report the same `file:line` with severity gap ≥ 2 and debate fails to resolve.
    4. Finding quality gate failure — new `Finding Quality Guardrail` in `_reviewer-base.md` filters bikeshedding / defensive / hypothetical / style-only findings before output; if nothing remains, reviewer self-reports as "degraded" via a `### Reviewer self-assessment` section and escalates.
  - **Finding fingerprint specification**: `sha1(normalize(file_path) + ":" + category + ":" + normalize(message))` with identifier masking and Jaccard token similarity > 0.7 for near-match detection. See `start.md` Phase 5.4.1.0 for the full spec.
  - **Minor version bump**: 0.3.10 → 0.4.0 (6 version files synchronized).
  - **Removed-key handling**: The three removed keys are silently ignored at runtime. There is no `/rite:lint` deprecation scan or warning for them.
  - **No cycle-count safety limit (by design)**: There is intentionally no hidden iteration guard. The 4 quality signals are the sole termination mechanism. Reintroducing an iteration counter would contradict the core goal of this release (removing cycle-count-based degradation).

### Migration guide

Existing users with any of the following in `rite-config.yml` should remove those lines:

```yaml
# Remove all three:
review:
  loop:
    severity_gating_cycle_threshold: 5
    scope_lock_cycle_threshold: 7
safety:
  max_review_fix_loops: 7
```

The keys are silently ignored at runtime in v0.4.0. There is no functional replacement — non-convergence is now detected automatically by the four quality signals and no cycle-count threshold needs to be configured.

If you previously relied on `max_review_fix_loops` hitting a hard limit to escape runaway loops, the same safety is now provided by Quality Signal 1 (fingerprint cycling) which fires on the **second** occurrence of any finding — typically faster than any cycle-count threshold would have tripped.

### Changed

- **Review-Fix Cycle Overhaul (Fail-Fast Response + Separate Issue user confirmation + configuration layer)** — **BREAKING CHANGE** (finalizes the rollout, which began with the principles doc layer, the reviewer exit layer, and the Fact-Check layer). Wires the `fix` response layer and configuration layer to the previously-merged principle/exit/fact-check layers.
  - `plugins/rite/commands/pr/fix.md` Phase 2 now begins with a **Fail-Fast Response Principle** section enforcing a 4-item checklist (`throw/raise` propagation / existing error boundaries / not hiding via null-checks / fix the test instead) before deciding a fix approach. Adopting a fallback requires an explicit justification in the commit message; unthinking defensive code is re-flagged at Phase 5 re-review.
  - `plugins/rite/commands/pr/fix.md` Phase 4.3.3 **removes the E2E `AskUserQuestion` skip** — separate-issue creation is now gated by user confirmation **regardless** of caller (E2E `/rite:issue:start` loop or standalone). Options are unified to `retry in current PR / create separate issue / withdraw`, all of which converge to `findings == 0` so the review-fix loop still terminates.
  - `plugins/rite/commands/pr/fix.md` and `plugins/rite/commands/issue/start.md`: the `"severity_gating"` convergence strategy has been **removed**. All PR-originating findings must be addressed within the current PR regardless of severity (本 PR 完結原則). `rite-config.yml` `fix.severity_gating.enabled` is retained as a deprecated compatibility key pinned to `false`. Non-convergence is now handled via the unified `AskUserQuestion` route in fix.md Phase 4.3.3. Use `"batched"` or `"scope_lock"` strategy for non-convergence mitigation instead.
  - `plugins/rite/templates/config/rite-config.yml` adds **config scaffolding keys** (declaration only, runtime wiring tracked as a follow-up): `review.observed_likelihood_gate.*`, `review.fail_fast_first.*`, `review.separate_issue_creation.*`, `fix.fail_fast_response`. The `fix.severity_gating.enabled: false` key is retained as a deprecated compatibility shim and is actively honored (pinned to `false`). **Known limitation**: The non-deprecation scaffolding keys (`observed_likelihood_gate`, `fail_fast_first`, `separate_issue_creation`, `fail_fast_response`) are **not yet referenced by conditional runtime logic** in `commands/` / `agents/` / `skills/` / `hooks/`. The new behavior (Fail-Fast Response Principle, always-confirm separate-issue creation) is hardcoded in `fix.md` Phase 2 / Phase 4.3.3 prose and cannot currently be disabled via config. These keys are provided so users can see the intended configuration surface; wiring them to conditional branches is tracked as a follow-up Issue.
  - `plugins/rite/i18n/{ja,en}/pr.yml` adds four i18n message keys (`review_fail_fast_first_warning`, `review_observed_likelihood_demotion_notice`, `review_separate_issue_user_confirmation_question`, `fix_fail_fast_response_checklist_prompt`) with ja/en parity. **Known limitation**: these keys are **not yet referenced** via the `{i18n:key_name}` lookup in `commands/` / `skills/` / `agents/`. The corresponding prompts in `fix.md` / `review.md` currently embed their text directly. Call-site wiring is tracked as a follow-up.
  - **Migration guide**: Existing users with `fix.severity_gating.enabled: true` in `rite-config.yml` will find the key silently pinned to `false`. Non-convergence is now resolved via the `retry in current PR / create separate issue / withdraw` `AskUserQuestion` at fix.md Phase 4.3.3. Users who relied on automatic severity-based deferral should adopt `"batched"` or `"scope_lock"` strategy. **Opt-out limitation**: the other new config keys (`observed_likelihood_gate`, `fail_fast_first`, `separate_issue_creation`) are **not yet actionable as opt-outs** — the new behavior is currently enforced unconditionally in the prose. To disable any of these, the corresponding prompt sections in `fix.md` / `review.md` must be edited directly until the wiring PR lands.

- **Named subagent invocation for `/rite:pr:review` reviewers** — **BREAKING CHANGE**. `plugins/rite/commands/pr/review.md` now invokes reviewer agents via `subagent_type: "rite:{reviewer_type}-reviewer"` (scoped named subagent) instead of `subagent_type: general-purpose`. Under named subagent invocation, each reviewer's agent file body (`plugins/rite/agents/{reviewer_type}-reviewer.md`) becomes the sub-agent's **system prompt** automatically, and YAML frontmatter (`model`, `tools`) is honored by the runtime. This gives reviewer discipline stronger system-prompt-level enforcement (rather than user-prompt injection which can be diluted) and activates per-reviewer model pins (9 reviewers pinned to `model: opus`). A reviewer_type → subagent_type mapping table was added for the 13 reviewers. Empirical verification confirmed that the `rite:` prefix is mandatory in plugin distribution — bare `{reviewer_type}-reviewer` fails agent resolution with `Agent type not found` error. **User impact**: users previously running reviews on sonnet will see forced opus upgrade for 9 reviewers and a corresponding cost increase (opt-out by removing `model: opus` from individual agent frontmatters). See `docs/migration-guides/review-named-subagent.md` for the full migration guide, opus recommendation rationale, and 3 rollback scenarios (all-reviewer resolution failure / tech-writer Bash permission / verification mode output format broken)
- **`{agent_identity}` placeholder renamed to `{shared_reviewer_principles}` in `review.md`** — **BREAKING CHANGE** (for rite plugin developers editing `review.md` templates). `review.md` now extracts only the shared reviewer principles from `_reviewer-base.md` (Reviewer Mindset / Cross-File Impact Check / Confidence Scoring). Part B (agent-specific identity) extraction was removed entirely — it is no longer needed because the named subagent system prompt delivers agent-specific discipline directly. This is a **hybrid approach**: agent body → system prompt (via named subagent), shared principles → user prompt (via `{shared_reviewer_principles}`). The alternative (inlining shared principles into 13 agent files) was rejected to preserve `_reviewer-base.md` as the single source of truth. The review template sections `## あなたのアイデンティティと検出プロセス` were renamed to `## 共通レビュー原則` to reflect the narrower scope. Preserves the Part A bug fix that ensures Cross-File Impact Check reaches reviewers
- **Retry classification extended with `subagent resolution failure` in `review.md`** — Added a new retry classification entry for the case where the Task tool cannot resolve a scoped subagent name (e.g., `Agent type 'rite:code-quality-reviewer' not found. Available agents: ...`). Retry: **No**. Action: fail immediately with the scoped name used and the error message. Do NOT silently fall back to `general-purpose` — that would defeat the named subagent quality improvement. If all reviewers fail this way, the orchestrator prompts the user via `AskUserQuestion` (retry / rollback to `general-purpose` temporarily / abort review). Classification detection pattern: Task tool response contains `Agent type '{scoped_name}' not found`

- **docs: reflect v0.4.0+ implementation across SPEC / README / CLAUDE.md / CHANGELOG** — Multi-PR documentation alignment sweep after v0.4.0:
  - Commands table + Agent File Format Note — added `/rite:issue:recall` to README / README.ja / SPEC / SPEC.ja Commands tables, added `/rite:init --upgrade` to README.ja, replaced the `subagent_type: general-purpose` note with the named-subagent description
  - SPEC Plugin Structure tree refreshed to match v0.4.0+ file layout (commands/issue sub-skills, commands/pr/references, commands/wiki, agents/_reviewer-base, skills/{investigate,wiki}, hooks/{scripts,tests}, templates/{config,review,wiki}, scripts expansion, references expansion); Configuration section compressed to a pointer to `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`; Hook Specification extended with post-compact / phase-transition-whitelist / verify-terminal-output (removed) / session-ownership / issue-comment-wm-sync / wiki-ingest-trigger + wiki-query-inject / workflow-incident-emit / hook-preamble / helper-scripts sub-sections
  - CLAUDE.md architecture diagram refreshed; `docs/BEST_PRACTICES_ALIGNMENT.md` archived under `docs/archive/` as historical v0.1–v0.3 reference
  - CHANGELOG Unreleased populated with post-v0.4.0 develop activity
  - Repo-wide version rename 1.0.0 → 0.4.0 (next release planned as v0.4.0 not v1.0.0); version files, README badges, CHANGELOG [1.0.0] entry → [0.4.0], and internal `v1.0.0` references updated
- **Bidirectional backlink format unified to colon notation** across `commands/` — `refactor(commands)` aligning Wiki cross-reference style project-wide, and extending existing DRIFT-CHECK ANCHOR blocks in `wiki/ingest.md` / `wiki/lint.md` with bidirectional backlink entries.
- **Semantic anchor migration** — replaced residual hard-coded line-number literals in `commands/init.md:145` and `hooks/scripts/gitignore-health-check.sh:298` with semantic anchors resilient to future edits.
- **`/rite:wiki:lint` `--auto` early-return alignment** — Phase 1.1 / 1.3 early-return paths aligned with the Phase 9.2 three-piece convention so sentinel / status-line / continuation-hint emission is uniform.
- **Wiki skill polish** — `skills/wiki/SKILL.md` EN description aligned with its canonical form; `wiki/lint.md` completion-report UX output order aligned with the canonical frontmatter order.

### Added

- **Workflow incident auto-registration mechanism** — `/rite:issue:start` now auto-detects workflow blockers (Skill load failure, hook abnormal exit, manual fallback adoption) and registers them as Issues to prevent silent loss. New `plugins/rite/hooks/workflow-incident-emit.sh` emits sentinel patterns (`[CONTEXT] WORKFLOW_INCIDENT=1; type=...; details=...; iteration_id=...`) from skill internal failure paths and orchestrator fallback prompts. New workflow incident detection logic in `start.md` detects sentinels via context grep, presents `AskUserQuestion` for confirmation, and calls the existing `create-issue-with-projects.sh` with `Status: Todo / Priority: High / Complexity: S / source: workflow_incident`. Same-type incidents are deduplicated within a session. Failure to register is non-blocking. Default-on via new `workflow_incident:` config section (set `enabled: false` to opt out). 11 unit tests added under `plugins/rite/hooks/tests/workflow-incident-emit.test.sh`. Implements all 10 ACs (Skill load failure / hook abnormal exit / manual fallback adoption detection, dedupe, default-on, opt-out, recommendation-flow non-interference, non-blocking error handling). Driven by the meta-incident demonstrated in an earlier PR cycle, where a Skill loader bug was silently bypassed via Edit-tool fallback
- **tech-writer Critical Checklist concretized** — Added 5 doc-implementation consistency items: `Implementation Coverage`, `Enumeration Completeness`, `UX Flow Accuracy`, `Order-Emphasis Consistency`, and `Screenshot Presence`. Each item carries a verification method (Grep/Read/Glob), and 3 new sample rows have been added to the Prohibited vs Required Findings table sourced from an internal documentation-centric PR case study (private repository, organization name redacted)
- **internal-consistency.md reference** — New reference file that complements `fact-check.md` (external specs) with an internal-facts verification protocol. Defines 5 Verification Protocol categories, Confidence 80+ gate, severity mapping, and a Cross-Reference section linking it to `tech-writer.md`, `review.md`, and related agent files
- **Doc-Heavy PR Detection** — Automatic detection of documentation-centric PRs in `review.md` (formula: `(doc_lines / total_diff_lines >= 0.6)` OR `(doc_files_count / total_files_count >= 0.7 AND total_diff_lines < 2000)`). Excludes rite plugin's own `commands/`, `skills/`, `agents/` `.md` files **and `.md` / `.mdx` translation documentation under `plugins/rite/i18n/**`** (prompt-engineer territory / dogfooding artifacts; non-Markdown translation resources such as `.yml` / `.json` / `.po` under `plugins/rite/i18n/` are not part of the `doc_file_patterns` numerator in the first place, so the exclusion is a no-op for them). Added optional schema `review.doc_heavy.*` (keys: `enabled`, `lines_ratio_threshold`, `count_ratio_threshold`, `max_diff_lines_for_count`) to `rite-config.yml`
- **Doc-Heavy Reviewer Override** — When `{doc_heavy_pr == true}`, promote tech-writer from recommended to mandatory and add code-quality as co-reviewer through one of three independent paths so the final state always has ≥2 reviewers:
  - **Normal path**: Add code-quality when fenced code blocks (` ```bash ` / ` ```yaml ` / ` ```python ` etc.) are detected in the diff. Pure-prose PRs do **not** trigger this path.
  - **Fail-safe path**: When the diff scan itself fails (`git diff` IO error, grep IO error, etc.), code-quality is added regardless of whether fenced blocks were detected, to preserve verification strength when the detection signal is unavailable.
  - **Fallback path**: When no fenced blocks are detected and the Doc-Heavy override produced no addition, the sole-reviewer guard adds code-quality as a fallback in the next phase.

  Passes `{doc_heavy_pr=true}` flag to tech-writer to activate the 5-category verification protocol defined in `internal-consistency.md` (Implementation Coverage / Enumeration Completeness / UX Flow Accuracy / Order-Emphasis Consistency / Screenshot Presence), makes the `Evidence:` line mandatory on each finding, and triggers the Doc-Heavy post-condition check in `review.md`
- **`/rite:pr:fix` accepts PR URL / comment URL directly** — `/rite:pr:fix` now accepts PR URL or comment URL arguments in addition to PR number, allowing findings from external review tools (e.g. `/verified-review`) to be parsed directly into the fix loop. Accepted URL formats include trailing paths (`/files`), query strings (`?tab=files`), and fragment identifiers (`#diff-...`) — all are normalized on argument ingest. Comments must contain a markdown table with at least 4 columns (with optional 5th `confidence` column). See `plugins/rite/commands/pr/fix.md` argument-parsing sections for the full argument spec, header detection keywords, and severity alias mapping
- **`[fix:pushed-wm-stale]` output pattern** — `/rite:pr:fix` now emits `[fix:pushed-wm-stale]` when the work memory update soft-failed. Firing conditions map 1:1 to the reason table in `commands/pr/fix.md` — each natural-language phrase below annotates its corresponding `reason` label. See the reason table for the complete list of `reason` values:
  - `current_body` empty → `current_body_empty`
  - `issue_number` not found → `issue_number_not_found`
  - PATCH 4xx/5xx → `patch_failed`
  - `pr_body` grep IO error → `pr_body_grep_io_error` (+ `mktemp_failed_pr_body_grep_err` for its stderr tempfile)
  - branch grep IO error → `branch_grep_io_error` (+ `mktemp_failed_branch_grep_err`)
  - `gh api comments` fetch failure → `gh_api_comments_fetch_failed` (+ `mktemp_failed_gh_api_err`)
  - Python script unexpected exit (generic) → `python_unexpected_exit_$py_exit`
  - `git diff` failure (Python sentinel detection) → `python_sentinel_detected` (reserved exclusively for `GIT_DIFF_FAILED_SENTINEL` match via `sys.exit(2)`)
  - work memory body corruption detected → `wm_body_empty_or_too_short` / `wm_header_missing` / `wm_body_too_small`
  - mktemp failure → `mktemp_failed_*` family (`mktemp_failed_pr_body_tmp`, `mktemp_failed_body_tmp`, `mktemp_failed_tmpfile`, `mktemp_failed_files_tmp`, `mktemp_failed_history_tmp`, `mktemp_failed_diff_stderr_tmp`, etc.)

  The `git diff` failure path also routes through `WM_UPDATE_FAILED=1; reason=python_sentinel_detected` (via Python `sys.exit(2)` and bash `exit 1`). The bash `exit 1` only kills the current bash invocation, but the retained `WM_UPDATE_FAILED=1` flag survives in the conversation context — the soft-failure evaluation still runs, detects the flag via row 2 of the evaluation-order table, and emits `[fix:pushed-wm-stale]` (NOT `[fix:error]`). The hard fail-fast design ensures the PATCH is silently rejected, but the `[fix:pushed-wm-stale]` output pattern is the correct caller-facing signal (see `commands/pr/fix.md` evaluation order and `reason` table for the authoritative flow). Callers (`/rite:issue:start` review-fix loop) **must not** silently treat `[fix:pushed-wm-stale]` as `[fix:pushed]`; instead, they must surface a warning via `AskUserQuestion` and let the user decide whether to continue with stale work memory or pause for manual recovery. See `commands/pr/fix.md` caller semantics for the full contract
- **Bidirectional backlink format verification in `/rite:lint`** — `/rite:lint` now mechanically verifies that Wiki pages maintain bidirectional backlink references in the canonical colon-delimited form. Runs as a non-blocking structural drift check in Phase 3.x and surfaces mismatches in the final report.

### Fixed

- **`wiki-query-inject.sh` origin/wiki fallback** — `/rite:wiki:query` now reads Wiki content via `origin/{wiki_branch}` when the local `wiki` branch does not exist (fresh clone / separate worktree). Previously `git show "${wiki_branch}:.rite/wiki/index.md"` used the bare branch name and failed with `fatal: invalid object name 'wiki'` when only `origin/wiki` was available locally, causing `/rite:wiki:query` to silently return empty context after `/rite:pr:cleanup` on another worktree. Uses the same ref-selection pattern as `cleanup.md` Phase 4.W.1 Step 2 and `wiki-growth-check.sh`. Negative case (neither local nor origin) continues to emit the existing `WARNING: wiki branch not found` and exit 0 (non-blocking). Also adds `wiki_ingest_push_failed` sentinel emission to `cleanup.md` Phase 4.W.3 when `wiki-worktree-commit.sh` reports `push=failed` (rc=4 path inside ingest), so `origin/wiki` divergence becomes observable in the incident layer while preserving loss-safe cleanup continuation. Additionally restores the `wiki_ingest_push_failed` incident type that `plugins/rite/hooks/workflow-incident-emit.sh` was missing from its `--type` whitelist — all existing callers in `pr/review.md`, `pr/fix.md`, and `issue/close.md` that emit this type were silently falling through to the `hook_abnormal_exit` fallback branch, so the dedicated `wiki_ingest_push_failed` sentinel defined in `issue/start.md` ステップ 8.5 (旧 Phase 5.4.4.1 を統合) had never actually been emitted in practice
- **Part A extraction bug in `review.md`** — Fixed Part A section extraction from `_reviewer-base.md` that was dropping `## Cross-File Impact Check` (everything between `## Reviewer Mindset` and `## Confidence Scoring`). Extraction now covers all sections from document start to `## Input` heading (exclusive), enabling the 5 mandatory cross-file consistency checks (deleted/renamed exports, changed config keys, changed interface contracts, i18n key consistency, keyword list consistency) to actually reach reviewer agents for the first time
- **tools/model frontmatter drift in reviewer agents** — Removed `tools:` frontmatter from all 13 reviewer agents (`api`, `code-quality`, `database`, `dependencies`, `devops`, `error-handling`, `frontend`, `performance`, `prompt-engineer`, `security`, `tech-writer`, `test`, `type-design`) and `model: sonnet` from 4 reviewers (`code-quality`, `error-handling`, `performance`, `type-design`). Previously these fields were ignored at runtime (reviewers are invoked via `subagent_type: general-purpose`), but would have silently broken when the named subagent migration completes (tech-writer would lose Bash and break Doc-Heavy PR Mode; 4 reviewers would regress to sonnet for opus users). The 9 remaining reviewers retain `model: opus` as an explicit high-quality review pin (intentionally kept; opus was already the runtime-effective model and removing the pin would have regressed them to session default which may be sonnet). Related `docs/SPEC.md` / `docs/SPEC.ja.md` Agent File Format section updated to mark `tools` as optional (inherit) and the Current Agents table updated to reflect the 4 reviewers as `inherit`
- **Verification-mode post-condition check added** — `review.md` now adds a post-condition check (child of the Verification Mode Findings Collection logic) that validates each reviewer in `verification` mode emits the `### 修正検証結果` table. On initial detection, a per-reviewer retry (via the reviewer invocation Task tool) is attempted with strict verification template instructions; on persistent absence, `verification_post_condition: error` is set, the overall assessment is promoted to `修正必要` (unified with the escalation chain labels — `要修正` is a reviewer-level label and is not used for overall assessment promotion), and all findings from the non-compliant reviewer are treated as blocking. Classification vocabulary is `passed` / `warning` / `error` (unified with `doc_heavy_post_condition`). Retained flags `verification_post_condition` and `verification_post_condition_retry_count` (per-reviewer dict) are registered in the retained flags list and displayed in the verification mode template. Prevents silent pass when a reviewer skips verification output
- **`commands/pr/fix.md` reason-table drift** — Expanded the `reason` table to cover all 28 `WM_UPDATE_FAILED` reasons actually emitted in the work memory update paths (previously only 12 were listed, 16 were missing). The eval-order table row 2 now defers to "reason 表のいずれか" instead of enumerating a subset, eliminating the double-drift problem. DoD verification (manually executed): `comm -3 <(grep -oE 'WM_UPDATE_FAILED=1; reason=[a-z_][a-z_0-9]*' plugins/rite/commands/pr/fix.md | sed 's/.*reason=//' | sort -u) <(awk '/^\*\*`reason` フィールド/{in_table=1;next} in_table && /^\*\*/{in_table=0} in_table && /^\| `[a-z_]/{match($0, /`[a-z_][a-z_0-9]*[^`]*`/); print substr($0, RSTART+1, RLENGTH-2)}' plugins/rite/commands/pr/fix.md | sed 's/\$.*//' | sort -u)` returns empty (28 WM_UPDATE_FAILED reasons in emits exactly match the 28 entries in the reason table). The awk pattern is scoped to the `**\`reason\` フィールド` section to avoid false positives from other tables in `fix.md` (absorbed from C2)
- **Sub-skill return implicit-stop multi-layer defense** — Accumulated fixes hardening the sub-skill return → orchestrator continuation path against Bash heuristic-induced implicit stops. Covers `create-interview`, `wiki/ingest.md` Phase 8 auto-lint, `pr/cleanup` wiki-ingest return, and `pr/cleanup` wiki-auto-ingest Phase 5 boundaries. Includes `INTERVIEW_DONE=1` plain-text marker and `stop-guard.sh` case-arm `WORKFLOW_HINT` expansion with Step 0 Immediate Bash Action.
- **`wiki/lint.md` Phase 9.2 `--auto` continuation sentinel** — `--auto` output now emits an explicit continuation sentinel so callers can distinguish completed-with-warnings from silent-skip.
- **`pr/cleanup` completion message trailing blank line** — Removed the spurious trailing blank line after the "次のステップ" heading for cleaner terminal rendering.
- **Preprocessor-safe syntax migration in `wiki/` and `pr/cleanup`** — Residual `!`+backtick expressions that the slash-command preprocessor evaluated via bash (causing `slash command not found` failures) were migrated to the `if ! cmd; then` form per the documented convention.
