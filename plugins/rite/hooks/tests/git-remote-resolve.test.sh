# Tests for resolve_owner_repo() in hooks/scripts/lib/git-remote.sh (#1899)
#
# `gh repo view` (used without --repo by issue-comment-wm-sync.sh,
# projects-board-drift-check.sh, watchdog-status-mismatch.sh, post-compact.sh)
# fails when `origin` is an SSH Host alias unrecognized by gh's host allowlist
# (e.g. `git@github.com-work:owner/repo.git`, configured in ~/.ssh/config).
# resolve_owner_repo() sidesteps that entirely by parsing the remote URL
# directly — the host segment is discarded regardless of what it says, so an
# unrecognized alias can never break this path. This test exercises the URL
# formats the parser must handle plus its two failure modes (no origin
# remote / not a git repository at all), since callers rely on a clean
# non-zero exit to know when to fall back to `gh repo view`.
#
# Convention: standalone subcommand (`bash lib/git-remote.sh resolve-owner-repo`),
# not sourced — mirrors ensure-session-worktree.test.sh's invocation style for
# the sibling lib/worktree-git.sh standalone subcommand.

# --- Accept: URL formats resolve_owner_repo must parse (owner/repo regardless
#     of host string — this is the whole point: the alias case must parse
#     identically to the canonical github.com case). Each case asserts the
#     exact "owner<TAB>repo" value, not just "2 non-empty fields" — a parser
#     regression that leaks the host/port into the owner field (e.g. the
#     protocol-style branch stripping `:port` instead of the host) would
#     still produce 2 non-empty fields and slip past a structural-only check.
