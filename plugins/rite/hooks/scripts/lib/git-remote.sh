# rite workflow - Git remote owner/repo resolution
#
# Responsibility: resolve "owner" and "repo" from the `origin` remote URL
# without depending on `gh` recognizing the remote's host. `gh repo view`
# fails with "none of the git remotes configured for this repository point
# to a known GitHub host" when `origin` uses an SSH Host alias set up in
# ~/.ssh/config (e.g. `git@github.com-work:owner/repo.git`) — even though
# the alias resolves fine for plain git operations and `gh` is otherwise
# authenticated (#1899). Parsing the remote URL directly sidesteps gh's
# host allowlist entirely: the host segment is discarded regardless of
# what it says, so an unrecognized alias can never break this path.
#
# Usage (standalone subprocess only — callers never source this file;
# running the resolver as its own process means it cannot perturb a
# caller's `set -euo pipefail` / trap regime):
#   line=$(bash lib/git-remote.sh resolve-owner-repo) || fall back
#   IFS=$'\t' read -r owner repo <<< "$line"
#
# Output contract: on success, stdout is exactly one line "owner<TAB>repo"
# and exit is 0. On failure (no origin remote, or URL doesn't parse to an
# owner/repo path), stderr gets one ERROR line and exit is 1 — callers are
# expected to fall back to `gh repo view` in that case, not treat it as fatal.
