## Error Handling Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Read the error code and message carefully** - Error codes provide specific guidance
2. **Follow recovery steps in order** - Steps are ordered by likelihood of success
3. **Check Prerequisites** - Many errors stem from missing dependencies
4. **Consult documentation** - Use `/rite:workflow` or `/rite:getting-started`

### For Developers

When adding new error conditions to commands:

1. **Assign a unique error code** in the appropriate range
2. **Include the error code in the message**: `[ZEN-EXXX] description`
3. **Document the error** in this reference file
4. **Provide actionable recovery steps** - Not just "try again"
5. **Log error details** to stderr for debugging

### Error Message Format

```bash
echo "[ZEN-EXXX] {brief_message}" >&2
echo "" >&2
echo "Cause: {explanation}" >&2
echo "Recovery: {first_step}" >&2
```

Example:

```bash
echo "[ZEN-E100] Issue #42 not found in this repository" >&2
echo "" >&2
echo "Cause: The Issue may have been deleted or the number is incorrect." >&2
echo "Recovery: Run /rite:issue:list to see available Issues." >&2
```
