#
# PostToolUse(Edit|Write|MultiEdit) wrapper for bang-backtick-check.sh.
# Filters tool_input.file_path so the static check only fires when an
# Edit/Write touches a markdown file under the rite plugin tree
# (`plugins/rite/{skills,agents,references}/**/*.md`). Detection
# emits a stderr warning but always exits 0 — this hook is warn-only and
# MUST NOT block Edit/Write completion, following the Claude Code hooks
# convention that PostToolUse failures should not break tool execution
# after the fact.
#
# 経路 C — immediate per-edit detection.
# Companion to /rite:pr-create and /rite:ready Phase 1 pre-check
# (経路 D — pre-PR hard gate, exit 1).
#
# Exit semantics:
#   - Always exit 0 (warn-only). Detection / invocation error / scope
#     mismatch / hook plumbing failure all converge on exit 0 so
#     Edit/Write tool execution is never retroactively blocked.
#   - Diagnostic noise on stderr is gated by the underlying script's
#     own behavior — we just forward it.
