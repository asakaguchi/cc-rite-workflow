# rite workflow - Session Ownership Helper Library
# Common functions for session_id extraction and ownership checks.
# Sourced by hooks that need to verify flow state ownership.
#
# Functions:
#   extract_session_id <hook_json>  - Extract session_id from hook JSON payload
#   get_state_session_id <file>     - Get session_id from .rite-flow-state
#   is_per_session_state_file <path> - Detect per-session file structure (schema 2)
#   check_session_ownership <hook_json> <state_file> - Check if state belongs to current session
#   parse_iso8601_to_epoch <timestamp> - Convert ISO 8601 timestamp to epoch seconds
#
# Usage:
#   source "$SCRIPT_DIR/session-ownership.sh"
#   ownership=$(check_session_ownership "$INPUT" "$STATE_FILE")
#   # ownership: "own" | "legacy" | "other" | "stale"
#
# Role transition (Issue #681): With schema_version=2 (per-session files),
# session ownership is structurally guaranteed by the session_id encoded in
# the filename — the resolver (`_resolve-flow-state-path.sh`) only returns
# a per-session path that matches the current session. `check_session_ownership`
# therefore uses a fast-path "own" classification when the path matches the
# `*/.rite/sessions/*.flow-state` pattern, falling through to the legacy
# 4-state classification only for `<root>/.rite-flow-state` (schema 1).
# `is_per_session_state_file` exposes the same predicate to callers that want
# to short-circuit ownership checks (e.g., when reading a path that has just
# been resolved by `_resolve-flow-state-path.sh`).

# Extract session_id from hook JSON payload
# Args: $1 = hook JSON string (from stdin of the hook)
# Output: session_id string, or empty string if not found
# Note: jq parse failures degrade to empty so ownership check falls through to
#   the backward-compat "own" path. The WARNING is unconditional because
#   ownership classification feeds state-overwrite decisions; suppressing it
#   under RITE_DEBUG would let a corrupt hook payload silently grant ownership.
#   The stderr snippet stays behind RITE_DEBUG to keep the WARNING one line on
#   the hot path.

# Detect whether a state file path follows the per-session structure (schema 2).

# Why this exists (Issue #681): With schema_version=2 the resolver
# (`_resolve-flow-state-path.sh`) only returns a per-session path whose session_id
# segment matches the current session, so the file is structurally owned by
# this session and the 4-state legacy classification is unnecessary. Callers
# that already hold a resolver output can use this predicate to short-circuit
# `check_session_ownership` entirely; `check_session_ownership` itself uses
# the same predicate as a fast-path before falling through to the legacy
# logic for the schema-1 `<root>/.rite-flow-state` single-file form.

# Exit code: always 0
#
# Decision matrix:
#   path is per-session file → "own" (structural guarantee, schema 2 fast-path)
#   hook session_id empty    → "own" (backward compat: can't determine, assume own)
#   state session_id empty   → "legacy" (pre-session-ownership state, treat as own)
#   hook == state            → "own"
#   hook != state:
#     updated_at > 2h ago    → "stale" (safe to overwrite)
#     updated_at <= 2h ago   → "other" (active session, do not overwrite)
#
# Issue #681: the per-session fast-path replaces the schema-2 portion of the
# legacy 4-state classification with a structural check. The remaining branches
# preserve schema-1 behavior unchanged so lifecycle hooks (#680) and pre-compact
