# bang-backtick-check.sh
#
# Detect bang-backtick adjacent patterns in plugins/rite/{commands,skills,agents,
# references}/**/*.md that can trigger Skill loader history expansion and break
# Skill loading (backtick+bang adjacency in inline code caused /rite:pr:fix
# Skill load failure). The agents/ and references/ scopes
# were added because P3 (no-space-before-! variant) revealed that any markdown
# the slash command parser may load — directly or transitively via Read — is
# vulnerable, not just commands/skills entry points.
#
# Detected patterns (both are matched within a single Markdown inline code span,
# i.e. text enclosed by paired single backticks). **All occurrences on a single
# line are reported** — the scanner uses a while-match loop, so multiple triggers
# on the same line never silently collapse to one finding.
#
#   P1: closing-backtick-preceded-by-space-bang
#       regex: ` [^`]* !`
#       semantics: inline code where the character right before the closing
#                  backtick is literal "space + bang" (tab and other whitespace
#                  are NOT matched — this is the exact shape that broke fix.md).
#       Example that matches:    backtick-if-space-bang-backtick   (the broke-fix.md pattern)
#       Example that does NOT:   backtick-if-space-bang-space-cmd-backtick
#                                  (bang is not adjacent to closing backtick)
#
#   P2: opening-backtick-followed-by-bang
#       regex: `![alnum or single ASCII space]
#       semantics: inline code where the character right after the opening
#                  backtick is literal bang, followed by an alphanumeric or a
#                  single ASCII space (captures bash history-expansion shapes
#                  like "bang+word" while intentionally excluding the Markdown
#                  image-reference shape "bang+backslash-bracket").
#
#   P3: bang-immediately-before-backtick (anywhere on the line)
#       regex: !`
#       semantics: any literal bang character immediately before any backtick,
#                  regardless of preceding context. This intentionally covers
#                  ALL bang+backtick adjacencies — whether the bang sits at
#                  the closing boundary of an inline code span (`!`),
#                  in Rustdoc inner-doc (//!), in command-suffix style (cmd!),
#                  or in any other position. P1 covers a more specific
#                  space+!+backtick variant; P3 is the generic catch-all that
#                  also matches the P1 cases (intentional double-counting —
#                  the slash command parser triggers on bang+backtick
#                  adjacency regardless of upstream whitespace). Empirically
#                  required — the parser was observed still triggering on
#                  `` `!` `` lone-bang inline spans
#                  because they form bang+backtick adjacency at the closing
#                  boundary.
#
# These patterns were chosen conservatively to produce zero false positives on
# the existing commands/skills tree (verified at creation time on 70 files).
# Innocent patterns such as Markdown image `bang-bracket-alt-paren-url`, regex
# literal `bang-backslash-bracket`, and bash negation `if-space-bang-space-cmd`
# are intentionally NOT matched — in all of these the bang stays away from a
# backtick boundary.
# Note: an inline-code Rustdoc inner-doc span (`slash-slash-bang`) was innocent
# under the original P1/P2-only design, but P3 (the generic catch-all)
# now matches it, because it forms a bang+backtick adjacency at the closing
# boundary of the inline code span — see the P3 description above which lists
# Rustdoc inner-doc as a P3 target.
#
# Safe equivalents (writing convention)
# -------------------------------------
# When this check flags a line, the canonical rewrite depends on **what the
# inline code span refers to**. Two styles have emerged from the fix series
# and MUST be applied consistently:
#
#   Style A: full-width corner brackets (「!」)
#       Use when the span refers to the literal bang character itself as a
#       standalone token (e.g. "行頭を # または 「!」 から開始する").
#       Adopted in: commands/wiki/init.md L247, L547.
#
#   Style B: expansion form (`if ! cmd; then`)
#       Use when the span quotes a shell syntax fragment containing `!` as
#       an operator (e.g. "the `if ! cmd; then` rc capture is mandatory").
#       Expand the fragment to its full minimal form so `!` is no longer
#       adjacent to a closing backtick.
#       Adopted in: commands/pr/cleanup.md, commands/wiki/references/
#       bash-cross-boundary-state-transfer.md L153.
#
# Judgment flow
# -------------
#   1. Is the span referring to the `!` character itself (noun)? -> Style A.
#   2. Is the span quoting shell syntax that uses `!` as an operator (verb)?
#      -> Style B (expand to a runnable minimal fragment).
#   3. Ambiguous? Prefer Style B — expansion almost always reads naturally,
#      whereas Style A only fits when the sentence grammar demands a single
#      character literal.
#
# Both styles avoid the P1/P2 patterns above by construction:
#   - Style A replaces the backtick-bang adjacency with a non-backtick span
#     (full-width 「...」 does not interact with bash history expansion).
#   - Style B moves the 「!」 away from the closing backtick by adding the
#     command continuation (`cmd; then`), defeating the P1 space-bang-before-
#     closing-backtick shape.
#
# Out of scope: detecting the non-adjacent `if ! ` space-bang-space pattern.
# That extension is tracked separately (see the --strict mode proposal).
#
# Usage:
#   bang-backtick-check.sh [--all] [--target FILE]... [--repo-root DIR] [--quiet]
#                          [--skip-if-no-target]
#
# Exit codes: 0 = clean (or not-applicable skip), 1 = pattern detected,
#             2 = invocation error.
#
# --skip-if-no-target: when --all finds NO scan directory under the repo root
#   (i.e. this repo does not self-host plugins/rite/{commands,skills,agents,
#   references} — the "consumer repo" case where rite is used as a marketplace
#   plugin only), treat the run as not-applicable and exit 0 instead of the
#   exit-2 invocation-error diagnostic. Without this flag the exit-2 diagnostic
#   is preserved (default), so a genuinely misconfigured self-hosting invocation
#   still surfaces an error. The bang-backtick gate only protects rite's own
#   plugin markdown; a repo without that markdown has nothing to gate.

Usage: bang-backtick-check.sh [options]

Options:
  --all              Scan plugins/rite/{commands,skills,agents,references}/**/*.md
  --target FILE      Check FILE (repeatable). Path relative to repo root.
  --repo-root DIR    Repository root (default: git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
  --quiet            Suppress progress/summary log lines on stderr (per-finding
                     output on stdout is preserved; still exits non-zero on
                     detection). Use for CI log noise reduction while keeping
                     findings machine-readable.
  --skip-if-no-target
                     With --all, exit 0 (not 2) when no scan directory exists
                     under the repo root — the "consumer repo" case where rite
                     is a marketplace plugin only and there is no rite markdown
                     to gate. Without this flag the exit-2 diagnostic is kept.
