# cleanup-worktree-detect.sh — classify cleanup.md ステップ 4-W's session-worktree
# state from pre-resolved inputs, deriving the worktree path from the PHYSICAL cwd
# when flow-state did not record it.
#
# Why this exists (Issue #1622):
#   ステップ 4-W previously trusted ONLY flow-state's `worktree` field (`flow_wt`)
#   as the source of truth for "am I in a session worktree?". When a session runs
#   physically inside `.rite/worktrees/issue-{N}` but flow-state never recorded
#   that path (path-entered a worktree another session created, post-reset
#   flow-state, or a worktree-記録漏れ), the equality test `flow_wt == cur_top`
#   was false with `flow_wt` empty, so 4-W classified `none` and skipped the whole
#   step. The worktree + its checked-out local branch then fell into an air-pocket:
#   neither the in-session removal (4-W skipped) nor the lazy reap
#   (pr-cycle-cleanup.sh Step 5 self-excludes the running session's own worktree)
#   handled them, and (at the time) the lazy reap never deleted branches — so the
#   local branch leaked permanently. (Issue #1670 has since added a self-exclusion
#   to the 4-W live-cwd guard so the running session removes its own worktree, and a
#   merge-confirmed branch-recovery path to the lazy reap; this helper's
#   in_worktree_unrecorded routing remains the front-line fix for the detection gap.)
#
#   This helper adds a PHYSICAL derivation: with `flow_wt` empty but `cur_top`
#   shaped like the rite session worktree for THIS issue
#   (`<worktree_base_leaf>/issue-{issue}`), it derives `flow_wt = cur_top` and
#   reports `in_worktree_unrecorded` — routed identically to `in_worktree` by the
#   caller, but distinguished so the completion report can note the unrecorded
#   detection.
#
# Pure path logic (no git / filesystem dependency) so it is unit-testable with
# synthetic paths. The caller still performs the dirty check and the live-cwd
# guard against the returned worktree path.
#
# Usage:
#   cleanup-worktree-detect.sh --ms-enabled <true|false> --flow-wt <path> \
#     --cur-top <path> --issue <N> [--worktree-base <rel|abs path>]
#
# Output (stdout, single line):
#   CLEANUP_WT=<none|in_main|in_worktree|in_worktree_unrecorded>; worktree=<path>
#
# State semantics (matches cleanup.md ステップ 4-W routing):
#   none                    multi_session off, or no worktree association
#   in_main                 flow-state records a worktree but cwd is elsewhere
#                           (resume / main checkout)
#   in_worktree             flow-state records a worktree and cwd is in it
#   in_worktree_unrecorded  flow-state empty, but cwd is physically this issue's
#                           rite session worktree (#1622 derivation)
