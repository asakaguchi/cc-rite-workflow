# Contributing to Claude Code Rite Workflow

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Claude Code Rite Workflow!

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `jq` (required by hook scripts)
3. The plugin uses Rite Workflow itself for development (self-hosting)
4. Set `rite@rite-marketplace: false` in `~/.claude/settings.json` to avoid plugin dual-load collision when developing locally

## Adding a New Reviewer

A reviewer lives in up to 4 places that must stay in sync. Sync between (1)–(3) is machine-checked by `reviewer-registry-drift-check.sh` (run from `/rite:lint` ステップ 3.7.1) with one deliberate gap: a missing **Available Reviewers** row in (2) is indistinguishable from a logic-selected reviewer and is NOT machine-checked (invariant I2 is one-way) — verify edit location 2 against this checklist; (4) is free-form prose covered only by this checklist.

**Edit locations:**

1. **`plugins/rite/agents/{type}-reviewer.md`** (new file) — the reviewer's full profile (Role / Core Principles / Detection Process / Detailed Checklist (Expertise Areas, Review Checklist, Severity Definitions, Finding Quality Guidelines) / Output Format), injected as the named subagent's system prompt. Model an existing reviewer (e.g. `security-reviewer.md`); shared principles live in `_reviewer-base.md` and must not be duplicated.
2. **`plugins/rite/skills/reviewers/SKILL.md` — `Available Reviewers` table** — add a row with the display name, agent filename, and activation file patterns. Skip this table only for logic-selected reviewers that have no file patterns (e.g. `code-quality`, the fallback / co-reviewer).
3. **`plugins/rite/skills/reviewers/SKILL.md` — `Reviewer Type Identifiers` table** — add a row mapping the `reviewer_type` slug to the 日本語表示名 and agent filename. The slug MUST equal the agent basename minus `-reviewer.md` (e.g. `security-reviewer.md` → `security`); the drift check verifies this per row.
4. **(Conditional) `plugins/rite/skills/review/SKILL.md`** — only when the reviewer activates on diff content rather than file patterns: add a keyword-detection rule to ステップ 2.3, and extend the ステップ 3.2 selection logic if the reviewer needs special selection rules (mandatory promotion, co-reviewer conditions, etc.).

**Verification:**

```bash
# 3-way sync: agents/ files <-> Available Reviewers <-> Type Identifiers
bash plugins/rite/hooks/scripts/reviewer-registry-drift-check.sh --all

# Only when the Technical Writer row was touched: tech-writer pattern equivalence
bash plugins/rite/hooks/scripts/doc-heavy-patterns-drift-check.sh --all

# Regression tests for the registry check itself
bash plugins/rite/hooks/tests/reviewer-registry-drift-check.test.sh
```

`/rite:lint` runs both drift checks automatically (ステップ 3.7 / 3.7.1) as non-blocking warnings, so a forgotten Type Identifiers row or agent profile surfaces on the next lint (invariants I1/I3) even if you skip manual verification. A forgotten **Available Reviewers** row is the one gap the check cannot see (indistinguishable from a logic-selected reviewer) — verify edit location 2 manually.

## Hook Development Guide

Hooks are shell scripts that respond to Claude Code lifecycle events. They are registered via `plugins/rite/hooks/hooks.json` (native plugin hook management) and executed automatically by Claude Code. For legacy setups without `hooks.json`, `/rite:init` falls back to registering hooks under the `hooks` key in `.claude/settings.local.json` — see the Hook Events and Registration section below.

### Hook Directory Structure

Representative entries (not exhaustive — see the note below):

```
plugins/rite/hooks/
├── session-start.sh / session-end.sh        # SessionStart / SessionEnd lifecycle hooks
├── pre-compact.sh / post-compact.sh          # PreCompact / PostCompact (context compaction)
├── pre-tool-bash-guard.sh                    # PreToolUse (Bash): blocks known-bad command patterns
├── post-tool-wm-sync.sh                      # PostToolUse (Bash): auto-creates local work memory
├── stop-loop-continuation.sh                 # Stop: consume one-shot handoff → re-inject next review↔fix loop / cleanup chain / finalize
├── flow-state.sh                             # Unified per-session flow-state management
├── session-ownership.sh / hook-preamble.sh   # Sourced helper libraries (not registered hooks)
├── work-memory-*.sh / local-wm-update.sh     # Local work memory read / write / lock helpers
├── issue-body-safe-update.sh                 # Safe Issue body fetch / apply with backup
├── wiki-ingest-trigger.sh / wiki-query-inject.sh  # Wiki ingest / query helpers (invoked from skills)
├── _resolve-*.sh / _validate-*.sh            # Internal session-id / state-root helpers
├── hooks.json                                # Native plugin hook registration (Claude Code reads this)
├── scripts/                                  # Internal helper scripts (drift-check, wiki commit, etc.)
└── tests/                                    # Hook test suite
```

> **Note**: This is a representative list, not a complete enumeration. The canonical full list is the `plugins/rite/hooks/` directory itself (and the Plugin Structure section of `docs/SPEC.md`). Only the seven events above — `SessionStart` / `SessionEnd` / `PreCompact` / `PostCompact` / `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` / `Stop` — are registered in `hooks.json` (verify with `jq '.hooks | keys[]' plugins/rite/hooks/hooks.json`); every other `.sh` is a sourced helper library or a script invoked from skills. New hooks are added to the directory and `hooks.json`, so this section does **not** need to be updated for each one.

> **Note**: The `Stop` event is registered to `stop-loop-continuation.sh`, which consumes the one-shot `handoff` marker and re-injects the next review↔fix loop command (`/rite:review` ⇄ `/rite:fix`), the `/rite:cleanup` → wiki-ingest → wiki-lint chain continuation, or a terminal completion-notice (see the `handoff` field in `docs/SPEC.md`). This is **not** a stop-*prevention* hook: the legacy blocking `stop-guard.sh`, which made the LLM stall in thinking loops at phase boundaries, was removed, and general workflow halting is now prevented by the per-session flow-state structure and the orchestrator-level scaffolding contract instead. Compact recovery is handled by `pre-compact.sh` + `post-compact.sh` + `session-start.sh`.

### Hook Events and Registration

Rite Workflow uses native Claude Code plugin hook management via `plugins/rite/hooks/hooks.json`. When the plugin is installed (or developed locally), Claude Code reads this file and registers all hooks automatically — no manual edits to `.claude/settings.local.json` are required.

For legacy setups or environments where `hooks.json` is unavailable, `/rite:init` falls back to registering hooks under the `hooks` key in `.claude/settings.local.json`. The following is a partial example of that fallback format:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash /path/to/hooks/session-start.sh" }]
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash /path/to/hooks/pre-tool-bash-guard.sh" }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Available hook events:

| Event | Trigger | Input |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `SessionStart` | Session begins or resumes | JSON via stdin (`cwd`, `source`) |
| `SessionEnd` | Session ends | JSON via stdin |
| `PreCompact` | Before context compaction | JSON via stdin |
| `PostCompact` | After context compaction | JSON via stdin |
| `PreToolUse` | Before a tool is executed | JSON via stdin (tool name via `matcher`) |
| `PostToolUse` | After a tool is executed | JSON via stdin |
| `Stop` | The agent finishes responding (turn end) | JSON via stdin (`stop_hook_active`) |

### Writing a New Hook

1. Create a new script in `plugins/rite/hooks/`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# rite workflow - Your Hook Name
# Brief description of what it does
set -euo pipefail

INPUT=$(cat)

CWD=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.cwd // empty')
if [ -z "$CWD" ] || [ ! -d "$CWD" ]; then
  exit 0
fi

# Your hook logic here
```

2. Make it executable: `chmod +x plugins/rite/hooks/your-hook.sh`
3. Register it in `plugins/rite/hooks/hooks.json` (native plugin hook registration) and — for legacy fallback — in `init.md` (Phase 4.5.2) so it also lands in `.claude/settings.local.json`
4. Write tests in `plugins/rite/hooks/tests/your-hook.test.sh`

### Hook Conventions

- Always use `set -euo pipefail` at the top
- Read JSON input from stdin using `INPUT=$(cat)` and parse with `jq`
- Use `state-path-resolve.sh` to resolve the state root directory
- For guard hooks (e.g., `pre-tool-bash-guard.sh`): exit code `0` means "allow", non-zero means "block"
- For non-guard hooks (e.g., `session-start.sh`, `session-end.sh`): exit code `0` indicates successful execution
- Use `mktemp` for temporary files with `trap 'rm -f "$tmpfile"' EXIT` for cleanup
- Keep hooks fast — they run on every matching event

## Shell Script Testing

The project uses a lightweight custom test framework (not bats) located in `plugins/rite/hooks/tests/`.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bash plugins/rite/hooks/tests/run-tests.sh

# Run a single test
bash plugins/rite/hooks/tests/pre-tool-bash-guard.test.sh
```

### Test File Structure

Test files follow the `*.test.sh` naming convention. Each test file has this structure:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Tests for your-hook.sh
# Usage: bash plugins/rite/hooks/tests/your-hook.test.sh
set -euo pipefail

SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)"
HOOK="$SCRIPT_DIR/../your-hook.sh"
TEST_DIR="$(mktemp -d)"
PASS=0
FAIL=0

# Prerequisite check
if ! command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "ERROR: jq is required but not installed" >&2
  exit 1
fi

cleanup() {
  rm -rf "$TEST_DIR"
}
trap cleanup EXIT

pass() {
  PASS=$((PASS + 1))
  echo "  ✅ PASS: $1"
}

fail() {
  FAIL=$((FAIL + 1))
  echo "  ❌ FAIL: $1"
}

# --- Test cases ---

echo "TC-001: Description of test case"
# Setup, execute, assert
if [ "$result" = "expected" ]; then
  pass "TC-001"
else
  fail "TC-001: got $result"
fi

# --- Summary ---
echo ""
echo "Results: $PASS passed, $FAIL failed"
[ "$FAIL" -eq 0 ] || exit 1
```

### Writing a New Test

1. Create `plugins/rite/hooks/tests/your-hook.test.sh`
2. Follow the structure above: setup temporary directory, define `pass`/`fail` helpers, write test cases
3. Use `mktemp -d` for isolated test environments
4. Clean up with `trap cleanup EXIT`
5. Exit with code 1 if any test fails

The test runner (`run-tests.sh`) automatically discovers all `*.test.sh` files in `plugins/rite/hooks/tests/` plus the `test-*.sh` files in `plugins/rite/hooks/scripts/tests/`, and reports aggregate results.

## Worktree Workflow

When working on parallel implementations, Rite Workflow supports `git worktree` to give each agent an independent working directory.

### Configuration

In `rite-config.yml`:

```yaml
parallel:
  enabled: true
  max_agents: 3
  mode: "worktree"           # "shared" (default) or "worktree"
  worktree_base: ".worktrees" # Base directory for worktrees
```

### How It Works

1. The orchestrator creates a branch for the Issue
2. For each parallel task, a worktree is created:
   ```bash
   git worktree add .worktrees/{issue}/{task} -b {branch}/{task} {branch}
   ```
3. Each agent works in its own worktree directory (Read/Edit/Write only, no git operations)
4. The orchestrator validates each worktree (tests + lint)
5. The orchestrator merges results: `git merge --no-ff {task-branch}`
6. Worktrees are cleaned up: `git worktree remove {path}`

### Important Constraints

- Only the orchestrator performs git operations (checkout, commit, merge, push)
- Agents use only file tools (Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep) within their worktree
- Add `.worktrees/` to `.gitignore` to prevent tracking worktree directories
- Check for stale worktrees from previous runs before creating new ones

### When to Use Worktree Mode

| Scenario | Recommended Mode |
|----------|-----------------|
| Tasks modify different files | `worktree` (safe parallel) |
| Tasks modify the same files | `shared` (sequential) |
| Single-task implementation | Either (no difference) |

For detailed patterns, see `plugins/rite/references/git-worktree-patterns.md`.
